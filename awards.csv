we've come as the audience already knows by now this show is created to reminisce on what happened throughout 2022 where your favorite tick-tockers influencers and even celebrities get nominated in the most challenging and hardest categories of the Year 2022 was probably the most important year throughout pop culture despite how The Tick Tock Community went down although celebrities and influencers managed to give us the hottest dramas of the year including new artists and Tick-Tock newcomers that gained massive attention on social media in seconds that's why in this year's oopis Awards I decided to give you guys the chance to vote again and well the results have finally arrived without further do you guys make sure to grab a snack and sit tight because you're about to witness your favorite influencers and celebrities that have won this year for the oopies with hundreds of songs trending each month on Tick Tock it's difficult to a crown sound as the best one this year but when it comes to creativity and mashups they were able to bring back old songs and turn them into a modern sound which made millions of people fall in love with the sound and make the original song itself chart on the Billboard Hot 100. take a look at the nominees for this category Meghan Trainor made you look Under the Influence by Chris Brown due in time by Lana Del Rey I was never there by the weekend super freaky girl by Nicki Minaj calm down by Rina running up that hill by Kate Bush Yep this is a very tight one but anyways the oopis award for the best Tick Tock sound goes too super freaky girl by Nicki Minaj congrats Nikki for winning your first oopies awards and for also winning the best Tick Tock sound this year we're still waiting on that album Queen when it comes to tick tock newcomer you guys this category does not only include social media influencers that have been stuck on our for you page all throughout 2022 but it also includes influencers that went viral for their character and Charisma that made many people fall in love with them this year on the list we have I show speed Michaela Noriega young gravy Anna Paul it seems like a lot of you guys enjoyed this specific influencer based on the ratio of the rating but anyways the best Tick Tock newcomer goes to I show speak you know despite the cancellation and controversy speed has been through throughout this year [Music] honestly huge congrats to him before we continue announcing our winners make sure to like this video click that subscribe button and turn on your notifications so you don't miss any uploads for me also make sure to comment down below your favorite winner of this year's oopies and who you think the awards should have gone to unfortunately this year's category was down to only three nominations since many influencers struggled to deliver a good Bop unlike 2021 but I can gladly admit that the competition between these three nominations was very intense as they were all a few numbers away from winning the best song that was created by an influencer here are the nominations dolls by Bella porch golden hour by Jake die first by Nessa Baron Even though three of them worked very hard on their songs you guys decided to give your votes to the best song created by an influencer too dive first by Nessa Barrett congratulations award for one of your songs I know die first means a lot to you and so many people out there and I'm glad that this award went to the right person as much as I want to nominate multiple people in this category I decided to keep it short because we are all aware of the horrible songs and sounds that went viral on social media specifically Tick Tock and with these nominations you guys were able to vote and choose the worst song that was created by an influencer here are the nominees All the Things I Hate About You by Chase Hudson if you ask me to by Charlie danielio World Cup by I show speed period up period uh by Brit Barbie and the oopies award for the worst song that was created by an influencer goes too you asked me by Charlie Daniels I'm not sure if this was highly expected but it seems that tons of y'all dislike Charlie demelio's new song the most this year I mean it says a lot about her music career where do I even start with this year's category I mean I literally get jump scared once I see these couples pop up on my phone every day not because of their unmatched personalities but because of the age difference and the weirdness that goes on in their relationship as you all have already guessed here are the nominees for the most cringe couple on social media Charlie demelio and Landon Barker Billy eilish and Jesse Rutherford young gravy and Sherry easterling Mesa Barrett and Jaden Hustler Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson it's insane to see how many inappropriate fake and weird couples that went viral this year but surprisingly you guys you voted on this specific couple as the most cringe for this year and of course y'all chose young gravy and Sherry Easter honestly I couldn't agree more on this especially after they traumatized an entire generation with this picture anyways huge congrats to them now let's move on to a difficult and competitive part of the nominations this year and that is I think this is probably one of the most important categories in the oopies awards because the point of my channel is to talk about influencers that have been in scandals and based on the videos that I've made this year about them the nominations came down to five influencers who not only got involved in multiple controversies this year but also got themselves in big trouble that made their career take an unexpected turn and here are the nominees for the worst influencer Andrew Tate I show speed Nikita dragon Ned Fulmer Sienna May Gomez and the oopy for the worst influencer of 2022 goes to drum roll please Andrew Tate I wouldn't have been disappointed if Andrew Tate didn't take this award home but I'm glad y'all thought carefully about this category because this man deserves to be locked up in jail ASAP please I know that this category is a new addition to the oopies this year which is hella exciting and I know y'all have been waiting patiently for it to arrive but as we've seen on social media this past year the majority of the nominees in this category have a huge risk of winning the most controversial celebrity out there but one of these nominees was good enough to annoy millions of you guys so here are the nominations for the most controversial celebrity Will Smith Kanye West Johnny Depp cardi B Willow and the winner of this year's most controversial celebrity goes to hold on y'all let me just open the envelope Kanye West huge congratulations for winning this year's worst controversial celebrity maybe he can shut the hell up next year and avoid putting his ex-wife and children in danger 2022 was the year of a lot of drama and I'm honestly excited to announce the winner of this category to you guys because despite the thousands of scandals that went down this year a lot of y'all feel the same way when it came to the most talked about drama take a look at the nominees Doja cat versus Noah schnapp Will Smith versus Chris Rock Kanye West versus Kim Kardashian Taylor Swift creating CO2 emissions pink sauce lady scandal dreams criticism over face reveal Johnny Depp versus Amber Heard and the oopies award for the most talked about drama goes to Johnny Depp versus Amber hurt here I totally understand that this situation shouldn't be specified as drama in this category but based on people's opinions and social media interactions a lot of them turned this serious court case into drama and took sides between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard throughout the entire trial anyways let's just end the oopies awards with the last category and that is we have finally reached the last and most important category of this year's oopies award and that is the best influencer some of these influencers are old creators who went viral again this year and others are new creators who became people's favorites in 2022. let's take a look the nominees for best influencer are Charlie demelio Jojo siwa Nessa Barrett Mr Beast Tabby Lane Anna Paul [Music] a porch and the influencer who was able to shine this year and get you guys to vote for them in the best influencer category is Mr Beast congratulations Mr bees for winning the best influencer of the year I'm not surprised that this award managed to go to Mr B's because despite the controversies we've addressed about him over the channel he still made sure that this award goes to the hard work and effort he puts into his YouTube videos so you guys there you have it
