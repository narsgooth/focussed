to hit Full Throttle No need to keep you waiting and trust me I'm just as curious as you let's launch into the fifth annual oopes Awards and raise a toast to the madness and the Brilliance and the pure circus that made 2024 one for the history books right off the bat our very first category is the messiest beef of 2024 and ter rest me this one had everyone losing their minds this award easily goes to Kendrick Lamar versus Drake y'all Kendrick and Drake's drama this year wasn't just beef it was a fullon barbecue these two took Petty to Unreal levels dropping disc tracks that had the internet lit like fireworks on New Year's Eve like who remembers Kendrick's disc meet the Grahams Kendrick went for the jugular y'all he didn't just call Drake out he dragged the entire family tree the most Savage moment for me was when Kendrick literally addressed Drake's son saying I'm sorry that that man is your father let me be honest it takes a man to be a man your dad is not responsive I look at him and wish your Grandpa would have wore a and then he offered to Mentor Drake's kid like what that is not just a disc that is an emotional damage with receipts and let's not forget not like us where Kendrick went even harder but what really made this beef wild was how it spiraled into a debate about Black Culture Kendrick turned the heat up making it bigger than music while Drake's fan base was struggling to keep up this wasn't just messy it was historic and honestly we are still recovering but don't go anywhere because the next category is going to shake things up even more cuz when it comes to the most controversial talk of 2024 this one was a close contest between Kate Middleton Saga and the Menendez brothers the award for this category story had us pitting camps inside the Royal Family Guys the chaos that erupted when the royal family dropped that AI generated pick of Princess Katherine Middleton on Mother's Day that was insane in seconds Twitter was inflames with the hash where's Kate trending worldwide people were shook y'all and just when things couldn't get Messier Kate posted a video revealing she was battling cancer but wait experts came out saying even that video looked AI generated like wo what going going on in the palace and then we had the infidelity rumors swirling around Prince William and Lady Rose Hanbury let's not even start on the rumored divorce between Kate and William it felt like every week the royal family was serving us a new platter of drama and honestly 2024 was their reality TV season the Menendez brothers drama deserves its own Spotlight too especially with that shady Netflix documentary that got the whole internet debating Justice and morality but the Royals really stole the tea party this year yall moving on to the next category worst clout Chaser of the Year y'all and this one is a no-brainer the award goes to none other than Lil listen most people are over it like her Disappearing Acts and chaotic comebacks have always been a thing but this year she hit a new level of extra it started when nobody noticed that she wiped her entire IG clean and then out of nowhere news dropped that she was dead the internet went into a full meltdown only to find out that she wasn't dead but was allegedly battling some serious health condition there were emotional updates talks about surgery and boom next thing you know she's dropping a song like girl the Whiplash was real and even the most loyal fans were like nah we're done people wish her well but at this point the clout chasing formula is tired and nobody's biting anymore this brings us to the most unexpected plot twist of the year and oh boy this one's a wild ride the award goes to none other than Blake Lively and Justin baldon's drama y'all it all started with the chaos around the it ends with us film release Blake Lively was dragged to the dogs for treating such a heavy story like it was just another romcom the internet was not having it and honestly she was pretty much canceled for being insensitive people thought that was the peak of it all and oh how wrong we were fast forward a few months and boom the mess hits a whole new level Blake Lively turned the TBL and filed a lawsuit against Justin baldon and his production team accusing Justin of sa and running an international smear campaign against her and if that wasn't enough Justin baldoni clapped back with his publicist suing the New York Times for liel over their December 21st expose titled we can bury anyone inside a Hollywood smear machine the drama the chaos the plot twist y'all this one had us all gas ping but hold tight because the next category is just as explosive still on plot twist y'all JoJo siwa might not have snagged a single Grammy nomination in 2024 but she is walking away with something even more iconic and oopie for the cringiest moment of 2024 where do we even begin her debut as a bad girl with the song Karma was supposed to be her breakout Rebrand but somehow she kept bouncing back to her bow wearing Disney Vibes oh and then the te spilled that the title track was stolen from from another artist sparking a major Trend that dragged JoJo All Over social media and not JoJo insulting fans while on stage or being drunk at Disney add her relationship drama to the mix and you've got a whole highlight reel of cringeworthy moments honestly this award was practically made for her so congrats JoJo your efforts didn't go unnoticed all right loves moving on the most shocking influencer comebacks of 2024 and this one had Jaws dropping everywhere the award goes to n another than nikocado avocado nikocado Rose to fame with his Larger than Life mukbangs and dramatic personality but had been keeping a huge secret for years fans expressed concern about his health as he leaned into his over-the-top persona but surprise surprise in September Nick revealed that he was two steps ahead of us all turns out he had been secretly working on a major weight loss Journey while posting pre-recorded videos to keep up the illusion nikocado had everyone convinced he wasn't changing when behind the scenes he was pulling off the ultimate glow up nikocado transformation left the internet buzzing and honestly this award couldn't be more deserved congrats Nick you shocked us all all right loves on to the most successful Tik Tok comebacks ever and the crown this year goes to none other than Addison Ray Addison's Journey has been a roller coaster from dominating Tik Tok with her viral dances to hitting a career slump that had people counting her out her brand seemed to lose Steam and let's not forget the messy headlines her parents public split her dad's icky rebound relationship and the general ick Vibes surrounding it all it was a lot but 2024 proved that Addison was just biting her time after taking a step back she reemerged with a fresh perspective a revamped aesthetic and a Bop in the form of her single Diet Pepsi she found her Niche leaning into a playful nostalgic Americana vibe that feels authentically hurt and guess what it worked this comeback wasn't just about popularity it was about reclaiming her narrative Addison Ray went from being Overexposed to mastering the art of Being just elusive enough to make us all want more cheers to you Addison you are proof that a good Rebrand can work wonders and now hold on to your seats because the next category had everyone riding the most viral Tick Tock moment of 2024 this goes to who the f did I marry by Lisa atisa if you weren't living under a rock then you probably saw this Tik Tok series pop up everywhere her Saga of exposing her ex-husband's double life had the internet shook she dropped over 50 Parts each one more jaw-dropping than the last the twists the lies the drama people could not get enough her ex even tried to jump in and defend himself but let's be real the internet had already crowned him trash it was a binge worthy wild ride that kept us all hooked now let's shift gears and talk about someone who has been everywhere in 2024 the most trending personality of 2024 goes to Gypsy Rose Blanchard from being released from prison to divorcing Ryan in what felt like a heartbeat Gypsy has had a whirlwind year and then plot twist she's with a new guy Ken and Pregnant her reality show a whole other level of drama we've all been on edge waiting for her next move but let's be real we're hoping 2024 brings a little less controversy and a lot fewer pity party interviews for her but hey it's Gypsy so who knows what's next y'all know it would be such an injustice to only talk about the most controversial people but also fail to recognize some light moments that made it to the highlights of 2024 and so with that let's switch things up to a heartwarming moment that made everyone smile the best lookalike Trend moment Goes To None other than Timothy shalamay Timothy really came through this year when he crashed his very own lookalike contest imagine the surpris when he showed up to a gathering of his doppelgangers and vibed with his Timothy in the streets the whole thing was a light-hearted moment that warmed our hearts and reminded us how fun it can be to embrace the quirky side of Fame it's like he was hanging out with his long lost twins the perfect mix of fun humility and pure joy but that category wasn't as viral and hilarious as the funniest Tik Tok Trend in 2024 which goes to Jules the demure Queen Jules took over Tik Tok with her unique demure Persona cutesy Mindful and oh so lovably quirky the way she captured everyone's attention with her adorable almost too polite Vibe made her the internet's Obsession literally making her the highlight of the summer watching her walk through life as if every moment was a delicate mindful performance was pure comedic gold this trend was as sweet as it was funny Jules really had us all trying to perfect our demure looks in 2024 all right time to ruffle some feathers y'all let's talk about one of 2024's biggest flops the most talked about talentless raer and the award for a talentless rapper of 2024 goes to ice spice now let's not sugarcoat it 2024 was a year where ice spices rain took a hit while she had her moments this year her music and Persona felt more like a flop than a wave it's like the hype around her just couldn't keep up with the lack of real substance in her work the rise of sexy red comes at a close second to ice spice but clinched her own oopie for brain rot of the year as time went by it became clear that these two thrived in viral missteps to uninspired tracks their rap game has officially been questioned at least for now while still on the pop culture streets let's dive into the craziest rumors that rocked pop culture in 2024 the wildest rumor to make waves this year was the idea that Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter are in industry plans now this one has had people talking nonstop the theory went that both pop princesses Taylor with her insane career trajectory and Sabrina Rising as the ultimate Disney turned pop star might not be entirely self-made after all some fans and conspiracy theorists had the audacity to suggest that both stars were secretly handpicked and manufactured by the music industry to be the faces of modern pop it's all about that picture perfect rise to fame that seemed seems too well constructed Taylor with her ability to write hits at will and Sabrina who's basically been everywhere in pop culture lately had the rumor mill spinning about whether their success was the result of intense behind the-scenes manipulation of course this is all speculation nothing proven but it's still enough to keep the internet buzzing could they really be industry plants or is this just another crazy conspiracy that made 20124 even more outrageous only time will tell but this gossip was real loves interestingly the just mentioned talentless and brain raw Award winners ice spice and sexy red have also frequently been labeled as industry plants which just adds another layer to this whole conversation all right let's talk about the worst concert of the year now we know there have been plenty of mishaps on stage this year crazy technical issues bizarre fan Behavior and the like but one incident stands out as particularly alarming and deserves to be addressed on Friday December 13th in Arizona Billy eish became became the latest victim of an attack from a flying object during her concert while it's true that concerts often come with their fair share of challenges this one hit a nerve because it wasn't about poor planning or bad sound it was the sheer recklessness of fans throwing objects at artists while they perform Billy ish who has always been known for her connection to her fans was hurt by something that should never happen at any live event this Behavior not only jeopardizes the safety of the performers but it also ruins the whole Vibe of the event for others who are there to enjoy the music while the artists and the organizers are not at fault this has to stop as we move into 2025 let's do better concerts should be a place of Celebration not chaos enough is enough next up we have one of the worst influencer moments of 2024 which goes to popular Infamous YouTuber Jack dhy Jack took things way too far when he crashed his $300000 McLaren for clout not only did he wreck the luxury car but the crash also left his friend covered in blood and a truly horrifying scene that sent shock waves across social media while some might think that this stunt was just a reckless attention grab the aftermath was much darker this wasn't just a car accident it was a serious situation that put people's lives at risk all in the name of content fans influencers and even casual observers couldn't believe what they were seeing it wasn't just a waste of an expensive car but it also involved unnecessary danger and risk leaving people wondering if this kind of clout Chase should even be acceptable in 2024 this is classic Jack dhy Mo but we hope in 2025 he realizes that there are better ways to gain attention without jeopardizing lives in the process moving on to the best cancellation of the year which goes to Mr Beast 2024 was a tough year for him starting with the whole Ava Tyson Scandal followed by the Mr Beast games mask which put his entire brand Under Fire it felt like he couldn't catch a break as both situations sparked intense backlash other major contenders in this category included Dan Schneider whose dark past resurfaced thanks to the Nickelodeon expose on Netflix and Hawk to a girl who had her own scam expose going last flop proving her rise was short-lived but no one quite faced the heat like Mr beast making him the standout winner in the cancellation race and finally we have the most controversial celebrity relationship of the year goes to Ethan Slater and Ariana Grande clenching this award 2 years in a row a pairing that seemed like it was on the rise but ended up crashing spectacularly just when the dust appeared to be settling Ethan Slater's ex-wife Lily reignited the drama by dropping bombshell Revelations about the Duo's alleged Beginnings in infidelity their relationship was called out for being not just messy but downright selfish as fans and critics alike slammed them for pursuing a love story built on betrayal and while Kylie Jenner and Timothy shalamay were no strangers to controversy this year with their roller coaster romance causing social media uproar the public ultimately crowned Ariana and Ethan as the reigning chaos couple because let's face it few love stories have sparked such widespread debate eyebrow raising moments and Collective groans and there you have it loves after all the drama comebacks flops and Unforgettable moments of 2024 the big question remains who do you think had the absolute worst year was it one of our nominees or do you have someone else in mind thank you for sticking with us through all of the twists and turns of the pop culture roller coaster of 2024 y'all are the MVPs Your Love support and spicy opinions keep this community thriving and I'm so excited to bring you even more in the new year what do you want to see more of in 2025 let me know and I'll make happen see you in the next one [Music]

we've come as the audience already knows by now this show is created to reminisce on what happened throughout 2022 where your favorite tick-tockers influencers and even celebrities get nominated in the most challenging and hardest categories of the Year 2022 was probably the most important year throughout pop culture despite how The Tick Tock Community went down although celebrities and influencers managed to give us the hottest dramas of the year including new artists and Tick-Tock newcomers that gained massive attention on social media in seconds that's why in this year's oopis Awards I decided to give you guys the chance to vote again and well the results have finally arrived without further do you guys make sure to grab a snack and sit tight because you're about to witness your favorite influencers and celebrities that have won this year for the oopies with hundreds of songs trending each month on Tick Tock it's difficult to a crown sound as the best one this year but when it comes to creativity and mashups they were able to bring back old songs and turn them into a modern sound which made millions of people fall in love with the sound and make the original song itself chart on the Billboard Hot 100. take a look at the nominees for this category Meghan Trainor made you look Under the Influence by Chris Brown due in time by Lana Del Rey I was never there by the weekend super freaky girl by Nicki Minaj calm down by Rina running up that hill by Kate Bush Yep this is a very tight one but anyways the oopis award for the best Tick Tock sound goes too super freaky girl by Nicki Minaj congrats Nikki for winning your first oopies awards and for also winning the best Tick Tock sound this year we're still waiting on that album Queen when it comes to tick tock newcomer you guys this category does not only include social media influencers that have been stuck on our for you page all throughout 2022 but it also includes influencers that went viral for their character and Charisma that made many people fall in love with them this year on the list we have I show speed Michaela Noriega young gravy Anna Paul it seems like a lot of you guys enjoyed this specific influencer based on the ratio of the rating but anyways the best Tick Tock newcomer goes to I show speak you know despite the cancellation and controversy speed has been through throughout this year [Music] honestly huge congrats to him before we continue announcing our winners make sure to like this video click that subscribe button and turn on your notifications so you don't miss any uploads for me also make sure to comment down below your favorite winner of this year's oopies and who you think the awards should have gone to unfortunately this year's category was down to only three nominations since many influencers struggled to deliver a good Bop unlike 2021 but I can gladly admit that the competition between these three nominations was very intense as they were all a few numbers away from winning the best song that was created by an influencer here are the nominations dolls by Bella porch golden hour by Jake die first by Nessa Baron Even though three of them worked very hard on their songs you guys decided to give your votes to the best song created by an influencer too dive first by Nessa Barrett congratulations award for one of your songs I know die first means a lot to you and so many people out there and I'm glad that this award went to the right person as much as I want to nominate multiple people in this category I decided to keep it short because we are all aware of the horrible songs and sounds that went viral on social media specifically Tick Tock and with these nominations you guys were able to vote and choose the worst song that was created by an influencer here are the nominees All the Things I Hate About You by Chase Hudson if you ask me to by Charlie danielio World Cup by I show speed period up period uh by Brit Barbie and the oopies award for the worst song that was created by an influencer goes too you asked me by Charlie Daniels I'm not sure if this was highly expected but it seems that tons of y'all dislike Charlie demelio's new song the most this year I mean it says a lot about her music career where do I even start with this year's category I mean I literally get jump scared once I see these couples pop up on my phone every day not because of their unmatched personalities but because of the age difference and the weirdness that goes on in their relationship as you all have already guessed here are the nominees for the most cringe couple on social media Charlie demelio and Landon Barker Billy eilish and Jesse Rutherford young gravy and Sherry easterling Mesa Barrett and Jaden Hustler Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson it's insane to see how many inappropriate fake and weird couples that went viral this year but surprisingly you guys you voted on this specific couple as the most cringe for this year and of course y'all chose young gravy and Sherry Easter honestly I couldn't agree more on this especially after they traumatized an entire generation with this picture anyways huge congrats to them now let's move on to a difficult and competitive part of the nominations this year and that is I think this is probably one of the most important categories in the oopies awards because the point of my channel is to talk about influencers that have been in scandals and based on the videos that I've made this year about them the nominations came down to five influencers who not only got involved in multiple controversies this year but also got themselves in big trouble that made their career take an unexpected turn and here are the nominees for the worst influencer Andrew Tate I show speed Nikita dragon Ned Fulmer Sienna May Gomez and the oopy for the worst influencer of 2022 goes to drum roll please Andrew Tate I wouldn't have been disappointed if Andrew Tate didn't take this award home but I'm glad y'all thought carefully about this category because this man deserves to be locked up in jail ASAP please I know that this category is a new addition to the oopies this year which is hella exciting and I know y'all have been waiting patiently for it to arrive but as we've seen on social media this past year the majority of the nominees in this category have a huge risk of winning the most controversial celebrity out there but one of these nominees was good enough to annoy millions of you guys so here are the nominations for the most controversial celebrity Will Smith Kanye West Johnny Depp cardi B Willow and the winner of this year's most controversial celebrity goes to hold on y'all let me just open the envelope Kanye West huge congratulations for winning this year's worst controversial celebrity maybe he can shut the hell up next year and avoid putting his ex-wife and children in danger 2022 was the year of a lot of drama and I'm honestly excited to announce the winner of this category to you guys because despite the thousands of scandals that went down this year a lot of y'all feel the same way when it came to the most talked about drama take a look at the nominees Doja cat versus Noah schnapp Will Smith versus Chris Rock Kanye West versus Kim Kardashian Taylor Swift creating CO2 emissions pink sauce lady scandal dreams criticism over face reveal Johnny Depp versus Amber Heard and the oopies award for the most talked about drama goes to Johnny Depp versus Amber hurt here I totally understand that this situation shouldn't be specified as drama in this category but based on people's opinions and social media interactions a lot of them turned this serious court case into drama and took sides between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard throughout the entire trial anyways let's just end the oopies awards with the last category and that is we have finally reached the last and most important category of this year's oopies award and that is the best influencer some of these influencers are old creators who went viral again this year and others are new creators who became people's favorites in 2022. let's take a look the nominees for best influencer are Charlie demelio Jojo siwa Nessa Barrett Mr Beast Tabby Lane Anna Paul [Music] a porch and the influencer who was able to shine this year and get you guys to vote for them in the best influencer category is Mr Beast congratulations Mr bees for winning the best influencer of the year I'm not surprised that this award managed to go to Mr B's because despite the controversies we've addressed about him over the channel he still made sure that this award goes to the hard work and effort he puts into his YouTube videos so you guys there you have it this has been the third annual oopies Awards thank you so much to everyone who has stuck around to see the highs and extremely low lows that some of the biggest internet stars have hit this year but
