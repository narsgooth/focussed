11/05/2023,Everleigh Released A Song & People Are Not Here For It...( JoJo Siwa Defends Her),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCuV7bvv77g,202-11, JoJo siwa is back making headlines again and this time she's clapping back at all the people throwing shade at Everly lebrandt over her debut song like Taylor Swift and this time JoJo isn't holding back from calling out the online trolls for bullying a 10-year-old girl to fake DMS from Taylor Swift this story has everything okay Everly we've got some great lyrics here now the song is called like Taylor Swift so I think we should name drop as many Taylor Swift songs as possible now what Taylor Swift songs do you like what do you think we should use so Everly recently dropped her first song like Taylor Swift she was so proud of it and her mom and stepdad were promoting it everywhere she said the song was inspired by her love for Taylor Swift and just like the song's name the lyrics showed that love immensely in the song she sings about moving to Tennessee to find out who she is and making her parents proud in the course of the song her love for Taylor Swift really starts to show she says my hair is blown through the wind Taylor Swift on the radio all weekend sweet tea 16 on my trampoline yeah but that's not the part that has gotten the internet all mad at Everly in fact the controversial part of the song comes later at the bridge of the song when she Nam drops a bunch of Taylor Swift songs she sings like a love story like a Dear John like a bad blood and kind of like our song like I knew you were trouble you belong with me are you ready for it are you 22 made you shake it off or look what you made me do Never Grow Up never find a lover Spark fly 15 can I get a cruel summer that's okay don't worry about it I'll just look up a list of Taylor Swift songs and we will just put those in with the lyrics all right let's try Okay Okay Everly sing this now this has got a lot of people online very angry with some even comparing it to the infamous Rebecca Black song from 2011 Friday just take a look at these comments from people who weren't impressed by Everly song wake up the new Friday just got released she's going to be embarrassed by this like Rebecca Black did about Friday if you guys like this you owe Rebecca Black an apology it's giving Friday by Rebecca Black what's like a Dear John even mean like brah this is literally the Rebecca Black Friday of this generation so basically most people were mainly confused with Everly's choice of lyrics with some saying like a Dear John made no sense While others were of the opinion that referencing songs like Cruel Summer and look what you made me do we're too mature for a 10-year-old to be referencing this made people start questioning who even wrote the song in the first place of the man like a the last time like to the damn season and kind of like a false god like nothing new All Too Well 10 minute version are you seven are you a mad woman made you Cony Island would have could have sh question never breathe tolerated Gold Rush can I get a great War so rumors started spreading that Everly's parents were the ones who actually wrote the song for her but her stepdad Cole even made a Tik Tok claiming that Everly wrote the song herself but with a quick check on the song's description on YouTube I found out that the songwriting credits are actually given to the lebrandt family I mean Everly is part of the lebrandt family so that's why they put it there but her parents are also part of the family so they easily could have also written it I don't know what do you guys think well yes it is a possibility that Everly herself was like I want to be a singer I want to put out a song I think honestly the more likely scenario is that either her parents came to her and said oh my gosh Everly wouldn't it be amazing if you wrote a song and sang it and had your own music video or people on the parents' team because remember this is their full-time job they are influencers they use their children as their content anyways after people started hating on Everly song her mom decided it was a good idea to post one of the dodgiest looking screenshots ever that's allegedly from Taylor Swift herself and apparently Taylor heard the song loved it so much that she wanted to perform it with Everly at her next concert not going to lie I don't think for a second anyone in their right mind believed that this was actually Taylor Swift like who in the world gets told by Taylor I'm going to sue you and their first reaction is oh fart also why didn't Taylor start by saying hi I might be wrong but ain't a way this screenshot is legit purely on the graphic design of the cover like all I'm saying is they have so much experience creating content and it looks like they used Snapchat fonts over a picture of their daughter bro now of course growing up a child star herself JoJo siwa felt it only appropriate to come and defend her friend Everly she posted a Tik Tok lipsyncing to Everly song with the caption to everyone who has said anything negative about this song you need to calm down she also wrote a lengthy caption with the video saying all this with love as the now 20-year-old who was once the 10-year-old growing up in front of the internet I want to say that anyone that's been saying negative things about this song or Everly herself lose your ego and grow up first the song is adorable and insanely catchy and second bullying isn't cool it's not funny and it's not trendy ever especially when it's directed at a 10-year-old and her first song made by people much older than her some even adults if you've posted something knocking this you should be embarrassed I also without doubt can say that Everly is one of the kindest and hardest working kids I've ever had the joy of getting to be around and she absolutely deserves all of the love and success she has it's great that JoJo siwa is coming to Everly defense like somebody needs to like I agree that the hate has not been directed towards Everly but I think Everly needs to see that there are adults who are willing to go to bat for her and protect her so I think JoJo siwa publicly speaking out like that is positive for her yes now JoJo who has previously appeared in the lebrand family videos and has posed on the red carpet with Everly at the industry Dance Awards received a lot of support from people who didn't think it was right how Everly was getting treated in the first place people were leaving comments saying stuff like thank you for saying that Everly doesn't deserve any hate this poor Angel has been through the most this year the last thing she deserves is hate for a song that she clearly had a blast making I'm not surprised they are friends LOL but people hate on random stuff for no reason and I'm getting tired of it good for Jojo as a girl Everly's age when people hate on things I love to do it hurts Everly is still growing and she's a kid she doesn't deserve this especially with her kind heart and being on camera since she was three I don't think any 10-year-old girl should be bullied online by anyone nevertheless adults online also I do not think any parents should subject their 10-year-old child to The Bullying of adults online you get what I'm saying now of course ad missed all of this back and forth people were starting to say that it's not right how Everly's parents put her in the spotlight like that it also brought up the issue of how YouTube families are willing to exploit their children for views not really caring about the effects it might have on them in the future family channels are just so fuing weird why does this keep happening to Zealand's skin I don't know maybe see a doctor about it don't post a YouTube video with a thumbnail of your daughter's rash poor kids man now this isn't the first time the lebrand family has been accused of using Everly to get views when Everly was 6 years old her parents decided to play a prank on her and tell her that they were giving her dog away Cole and Savannah lebrand uploaded a now deleted April Fool's video titled we have to give our puppy away saying goodbye forever you okay come here what's the matter what's the matter Cole and Sav pranked their four-year-old Everly into thinking she'd have to give away their beloved family dog Carl so the video started out like one of their regular day-to-day Vlogs until the seventh minute where it cuts to Everly who is visibly sad and you can hear her parents telling her the fake news that they are giving her puppy away and then he asks her how she felt we're giving Carl away to somebody else because we feel like we can't take good enough care of him at our house the prank dragged on for a long time and when it was finally revealed to Everly that it was a prank the poor kid couldn't even speak we're going to let her give give him away but then s finally Whispers to her the whole thing is a joke after uploading the video people weren't happy about it in the comments they wrote stuff like this was emotional abuse hurtful and immature why parents flaunt their lives and children for the world is beyond me children who have no say if they even want to be on camera I think it's less about the prank and more about the a awkwardness about this family posting so much of their child for the whole world to see we'll be interesting to see how their daughter feels later in life that her whole childhood is out there for everyone to see forever I think they took this prank way too far it's just like saying your dog died and then your parents were joking doesn't matter if she's six or four still way too far as a teenager I would have broken down crying too I'm glad my parents don't play Such cruel jokes on me I'm so disappointed in Cole and Sav I mean this joke was AB absolutely terrible people should not joke like that everyone needs to chill it's just a joke really normally I would agree with this but the problem here is that they pulled a cruel prank on their child maybe you don't feel it's cruel but we're talking about a 6-year-old girl who doesn't fully understand the concept of it's just a joke to even put it in her head for even a few minutes that she would no longer have the dog she loves so much is cruel if they wanted to pull a prank on her they should have done something that was less harmless uh too far we need to reflect on why would grown-ups put children in that situation and how can such a situation disrupt important factors of Child Development such as trust attachment predictability consistency security safety however Cole and Savannah lebrand weren't done yet in another video they faked evacuating their house because of a wildfire but Savannah just texted me Savannah's taken every to dance practice I was in a tax meeting but she texted me saying that there's a huge fire right by our house and that uh we might need to evacuate so I'm actually going to drive those aren't clouds we don't have clouds in California that is the fire so as you guys can tell last time I recorded uh it's gotten it's gotten a lot closer I think it's like 4 miles away yeah so back in August of 2018 a massive Wildfire hit Southern California and made more than 20,000 people have to abandon their homes so the lebrand family decided to upload a video documenting how they had to evacuate their house in the video you can see Cole and Sav packing up their stuff and going to pick pick up Everly who is at her grandma's place they tell Everly in the car that they're going far far away from the fire and that she doesn't have to be scared anymore okay guys so we got ever with us now we just picked her up from her grandma so he you know that we're leaving the fire right going far far away we're going away from the fire so you don't have to be scared anymore yeah the rest of the video documents the family's trip to San Francisco where they show off their hotel in the spot where the couple first began dating 2 years ago at the end of the video Cole reveals that the family returned to their house after 2 days because the fire moved away however after that video went viral the lebrand neighbors started coming out and saying that they faked the whole thing a pair of famous YouTubers are being called out after claiming they had to leave their California home due to the area's Wildfire the neighbors revealed that no one even told them to evacuate from their house because they were in no danger there was no evacuation notice to L Ranch Marissa seus lives near the lebrand she says plenty of the neighbors are not amused by the social social media influencers and I just think it's really sad that they would exploit a situation that's as serious as a fire that so many people were evacuated um from just so that they could get more likes or more hits on their Channel The Neighbors were actually not happy with the thumbnail the lebrand had chosen to use for their video where you could see flames in the background and they were holding Everly and they looked very concerned the screenshot on their YouTube page is particularly offensive to this Lera Ranch resident see the thumbnail where it's them looking scared wow yeah that is just that that was never even we were never even near that that shot is meant to entice people to click on the video and clicks means income have friends who were evacuated in very scary situation so you know kind of making light of that I don't think was proper um just to make a buik people even began posting maps of where the fire was and it turned turns out it wasn't even close to the lebrand house which was way over at Lera Ranch y'all this family is just drama Galore almost everything they do just leads to more and more drama and the one person they keep at the center of it is always Everly what do you guys think is it right how the lebrand family just keeps constantly using their daughter to get more and more views let me know in the comments below till next time bye [Music] loves
10/29/2023,Jefree Star Defends Eugenia Cooney (and she defends him),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4StuiwKz_M,201-11, Jeffree Star is not standing for any of the hate that him and Eugenia Cooney have been getting recently she's been visiting him at his star Yak Ranch and I recently talked about how the two of them have been going live on Tik Tok together talking about all the fun they've been having but the comments they've been receiving have not been the best Jeffrey was already trying to tell people to leave them be a couple days ago but the comments have only continued and it seems like things got so bad that someone even tried to come to his Ranch and it played out the other day on live and Jeffrey was alerting his security about the whole situation yeah hello wait guys I'm going to mute you yeah there's someone outside of the house call the police right now Security's going to the gate yep call the police they're trespassing stupid mother things have been pretty intense but Eugene has been sharing everything that her and Jeffrey have been doing and she only has the best things to say about him she said that she's been having such a good time and she hasn't been this happy in a while and even people in the the chat were saying that she seemed happier there than at home and when talking about all of this she also wanted to address the fact that despite the fact that she's been saying every day that she's been having this good time people still have been trying to kind of like ruin it for her somehow you look so happy to thank you that's the thing is I I honestly have been and I still am I've been having like the best time so it's like it's just weird it's just weird how like you know I'll just be having an amazing time and you know just having so much fun with like someone that I consider really really special an amazing friend of mine and then people just like wanting to try to make things into something they're not it's like why yeah we've been having the most amazing time guys so I'm just kind of like at this point it's like whatever some of you guys want to say in the chat or try to make negative it's like I know it's not the truth guys so it's like yeah it's just kind of sad though that like some people like just want people to be miserable and just have like no friends it's like no guys Jeffrey has continued to defend her all week though anytime he saw some sort of hate he tried to just shut it down and the other day when Eugenia was on live doing her makeup he would kind of pop over to her phone and look through the comments and try and tell off anyone that had anything negative to say about the two of them hanging out a if it's hard to watch you can leave exactly you guys her skin is amazing in person thank you Jeffrey it feels so soft yeah theyve always like telling me like oh look she's looking so bad it's like must be a self-reflection maybe Becky thank you there's also been a lot of talk about whether or not eugenia's mom is with them or not and the other day Jeffrey said that she wasn't and it was just the two of them there in the house hanging out yes guys let's see guys no one's here me Eugenia and my assistant and my security guard there's no one else here remember when I walked behind you yesterday and they said it was someone else so just me nothing y'all I don't like people I like the least amount see I like the least amount of people a lot of people have blamed eugenia's mom for things over the years accusing her of controlling Eugenia and her social media posts so people were just wondering if she had also traveled to Wyoming and visited Jeffrey with Eugenia now despite them having said that it was just the two of them the other day there hanging out Jeffrey did try and defend Eugenia once again when he was monitoring her chat by saying people travel with their family all the time people people travel with their family all the time you guys yeah guys you know like sometimes like don't make it weird I know I don't know why they all have to make it into like such a like crazy like weird thing they go they would know what everyone thinks of everybody mhm we're just doing yeah we're just doing snow what is wrong with y'all be nice we we don't do any of that it turns out that her mom is in Wyoming but Eugenia and Jeffrey said that she's 5 hours away enjoying the sights you guys Eugene's mom is 5 hours away he guys she's not here she's enjoying the beautiful nature of Wyoming she enjoying Wyoming she's kind of just doing her own thing so yes like if you guys are just kind of waiting to see de MH it's not happening right now they on my life later when Eugenia was alone she said that Jeffrey and her mom get along really well and they both really like each other and that Jeffy has just been so nice and there's no reason why anyone shouldn't like him which like I said in my last video I think there's a couple people out there that would love to debate that with her but she only has the best things to say about Jeffrey in fact she even at one point said that she felt guilty about how much fun she was having with him and how good of a friend he was being to her I almost almost feel like bad like like how do I say it like I just feel like I've been so blessed and I'm just so thankful to have like you know getting to hang with Jeffrey this week he's like been such an amazing friend to me getting to you know also getting to hang with Mama J today just being surrounded by such good people and people just like showing me so much like love and kindness that I'm just like you know a lot of time like in my life I don't like experience like just such an amazing experience and I don't know I don't want to be like annoying I would never want to annoy him or annoy her annoy anybody but it's like you know it isn't it's it's just I feel like I'm so lucky and I don't know eventually her and Jeffrey just started playing into all the hate that they were getting and joked about her being Shackled and him being her conservator it certainly threw some people off though especially with the conservatorship jokes that she was making some people started to believe her a little bit and were like wait are you joking or are you being serious like what is going on here she later clarified that it was a joke but people were getting scared CU Jeffrey he's the best conservator yeah Deb's my mom yeah yeah him and my mom or like they're actually my conservators I just want to make sure your shackle wasn't too tight tonight how how's your an how's your ankle I think it's okay you know I think the ties aren't like too too crazy tonight if they are you just pess the button okay thank you so much Jeffrey like you were the best like giving me the best you just click the red button if it gets too tight okay I'll try I'll try to like properly press it it's also unclear how long Eugene will be staying with Jeffrey and she wouldn't really answer the question flat out on live someone tried to ask her and she didn't want to even finish reading the comment how long am oh we don't we don't need to talk about that um oh my gosh thank you evil girl I so I don't know why she didn't want to answer that question or like even read it but I scrolled up to see what that actual comment was and it was like how long are you going to be staying with Jeffrey weird that she didn't want to answer it I don't know what that's about but she did later say that she would be leaving at some point it's not like she's moving in or anything even though Jeffrey did joke about her potentially doing so she's amazing she's been here all week she she might as well move in she might move in part time love not with you and once he said this people flooded eugenia's comments once again to ask her if she was and she said no she didn't want to overstay her welcome she has been having a lot of fun but she just couldn't ask that of Jeffrey for her to like move in or anything like that even though she is really loving it in Wyoming and it's making her not want to go home at all do I miss home no guys I've been having so much fun here would I have to go home you know you got to go home at some point and I would never want to overstay you know but it's like of course I'm going to like go home when I go home but do I miss it no despite the fact that the both of them have been getting a ton of hate there have been those people who do think that the trip has been good for Eugenia based on what they've seen and what she's said and think that she does seem really happy so it's all over the place what people are thinking and feeling about these two hanging out Eugenia did try and talk about the fact that in the past she hasn't had the best people in her life and there have been those who have done her wrong but claimed that Jeffrey just wasn't one of those people you guys you guys can say what you want about some people but you guys don't really know the circumstances like like I said support whoever you want to support um but I'll just say guys that like the people I'm friends with now have been way better friends than people in the past that I've been friends with so I mean you know you guys don't really know everything in my life I don't mean to say that in like a rude way but and this is something that Jeffrey said in his live a couple days ago where he was like you guys don't know everything like there's more to this story all of that stuff and it's what she's kind of saying here that you don't know everything but some people feel like they do know at least enough to form an opinion and that they think that this is not good one thing is certainly clear here and it's that the two of them are going to be defending each other hard against any sort of backlash that comes their way but that is what they had to say to all the comments that they've been getting this week I want to know what you guys think about what they had to say and everything everyone has been saying let me know your thoughts in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye [Music] guys oh
10/17/2023,The Downfall of SssniperWolf Is WORSE Than You Think...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4BSd0zMRj0,196-11, Hello friends it's me you guys Sniper Wolf is in trouble again only that this time it's not her controversial content and YouTube drama nope it's something way bigger and much worse than that and y'all it is so wild that people are even saying that this could be the downfall of Sniper Wolf so sniper Wolf's hubby or let's just say soon to be ex-hubby Evan has filed this explosive lawsuit that has not only revealed her deepest dirtiest Secrets but he is also aiming to destroy sniper Wolf's YouTube career and honestly I don't know how Sniper Wolf will come back from this there is so much to cover you guys so without further Ado let's get right into it so y'all know Sniper Wolf was married to Evan AKA sausage guy and they presented this picture perfect relationship and from the outside looking in it all seemed rainbows and sunshine well the curtains have closed on their 10-year marriage and you guys that's when the real drama began so turns out SA wasn't just chilling in the background nope he's in fact The Mastermind behind sniper Wolf's YouTube magic of course she has always denied these claims and made it look like she is the backbone and soul of her Channel but that's not even the real tea here loves here's the craziest part apparently the sausage guy revealed in the lawsuit that not only did he write all of her reaction videos but he also produced all of sniper Wolf's game plays during her let's play days and this worked perfectly until their breakup you're probably thinking uh that's pretty common most YouTube channels are a collective effort so why is he suing Sniper Wolf well it turns out that Sniper Wolf tried to be a smartass after their separation and against better judgment she cut him off and literally kicked sausage out of the company you guys to the point that Sniper Wolf stopped sharing money with him fortunately for sausage he might have expected a sour end so they put everything in writing and signed it and doing things officially has really come in handy for him they're now headed to court so get get your popcorn loves because we're about to comb through this lawsuit Page by page because OMG you guys what her entire career has been a lie but before we get into this a little backstory just so you're not left hanging the drama train started rolling early on because it did not take long before sniper Wolf's dirty secrets were discovered for starters people started accusing Sniper Wolf of Faking gameplay and boy did she clap back shortly after that Sniper Wolf switched to reaction videos but once again she started playing dirty you see this du had figured out a way to make videos by putting in very little effort but still making a lot of money her formula was simple take another Creator's video do the bare minimum low effort reaction and upload the video on her channel the drama has just begun you guys slow down with the popcorn let's dive into the ongoing legal battle between her and the person who used to be her rock this is a 23 page carefully crafted document that shakes the very Foundation of her entire career what you're about to discover is stuff Sniper Wolf has been trying to keep under wraps throughout her entire career and let's start reading plaintiff Channel red LLC Channel red has at all material times been an Arizona limited liability group in good standing that has been doing business in Maricopa County Arizona defendant Aaliyah CES celes or defendant has at all material times maintained her principal residence in Maricopa County Arizona okay basically this is just to say that these two have been in business together and under contract now let's get to the meet in or about 2010 young and celes first met online while playing the video game Metal Gear online during this time frame young and celes exchanged cellular text messages briefly but otherwise largely ceased communication after a short period of time in or about 2011 celes began a YouTube channel under the moner her sexy sexy sniper cel's sexy sexy sniper YouTube channel had a largely negative reputation and was Infamous for posting explicit content cel's sexy sexy sniper YouTube channel was not affiliated with or otherwise related to the Future SS Sniper Wolf YouTube channel referenced here in both young and CES have taken measures to ensure that sexy sexy sniper YouTube channel could not be connected to the SS Sniper Wolf YouTube channel moreover SES has made an explicit record that sexy sexy sniper is not a derivation or otherwise connected to Sniper Wolf Monker or sniper Wolf's YouTube channel in or about December 2012 young and sles reconnected through text message and began regularly exchanging correspondence and communication guys do we really need to dig any deeper than this first of all this already confirms what most people have suspected all along Sniper Wolf was the one behind that controversial sex sexy sexy sniper YouTube gaming she's been denying it to the High Heavens but come on it's common knowledge that that channel did not gather followers because of gaming it was all about sniper Wolf's willingness to reveal more than just her gaming skills if you know what I mean so her followers weren't exactly Gamers to begin with more like well let's just say they were more interested in her knees and above but the plot thickens y'all there's more to this Twisted Tail so while people have been accused Sniper Wolf for not obeying fair use rules Sniper Wolf hasn't even been creating anything at all y'all she's been reading scripts yep you heard me right she's been reading a script prepared by her husband and as if all that wasn't bad enough it's now out there that Sniper Wolf was faking gameplay 2o I mean we knew it was bad but not this bad you guys you know who this reminds me of it reminds me of that one time when people literally zoomed in on one of of her videos and it appeared like she had a script but it gets worse you guys it gets worse you know what guys if this document is anything to go by then realistically speaking Evan should have just owned the channel and hired CES to be the face of the brand now turn over to the next page guys we're still in court the next several Pages basically spilled the secret that cel's job was just to read and react accordingly to the already prepared script after some time sniper Wolf's content shifted to reaction videos so you're probably thinking at this point Evan's job was done right wrong Evan was still the director filmed gathered content and was still the marketing Guru anyways their hard work started paying off almost immediately and they had a whopping 33 million subscribers by the time this legal document was being put together also bear in mind loves that during this time they were still splitting all the income 50/50 and all was good plus love was in the air literal couple goals you guys in fact according to of the lawsuit things were going so well that they decided to do what any young ambitious and successful couple would do to expand their empire they decided to get married they later expanded their business too so they were winning left and right in center Evan and celes then added two more channels Mr Sausage boy and little Leah since their establishment was getting bigger by the day they decided to put all their channels under one umbrella named the prior channels even then they were still splitting all the revenue across all the prior channels equally they then created a company named Channel red which Evan is now using to sue sles but here's the crazy part apparently sles owns 50% of that very company just when I thought I'd seen it all let's move on loves part of the agreement even said that the two lovebirds and business partners would have complete access to all the channel red channels and revenue and also take part in decision-making posting content and participating in all other potential businesses the company will car carry out and things were looking up for this couple you guys they bagged numerous sponsorships and brand deals and even won the Nickelodeon's Kids Choice Award for favorite gamer in 2019 and 2020 unfortunately for them while business was booming their romantic fire started to get dimmer and dimmer in September of 2022 the two separated and that my loves marked the beginning of a dark turn for both Evan and CES and Evan had no clue that cesh was done with him she no longer wanted to see so much as his socks in her house and neither did she want to proceed with the 50/50 joint partnership that they had enjoyed for years so what did she do she kicked the man out and took over the business I don't know about y'all but with the amount of insensitivity and greed that Sniper Wolf has been known for for years maybe this was her plan all along also I wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was her idea to create the joint company because remember y'all at first all all the money would first go to Evan's account then he would transfer Celestia's share to hers but the moment they created this company all the funds were directed at the company's account and soon enough they separated and now Evan has been locked out of the channels and the company so after all this now/ decided that this was her business and that she had the power to even fire her co-founder and equal business partner to make matters even worse how come these two had every other agreement carefully documented except the very last one which was the creation of the company how is it that this was the only agreement where they relied on a verbal understanding when this very company served as the umbrella for all their businesses and channels doesn't this sound like something out of a well-played con anyways after Evan was kicked out slush started hatching conspiracies with the brand manager Kevin gold to engage in business deals and Arrangements outside the red Channel company in essence they were hiding things from Evan their business partner well that's a sure way to land in a legal mess and here we are so at this point the drama just gets thicker and thicker because Evan found out about these Shady deals but CES being as sneaky as she is did not stop and she did the worst you guys CES decided to open multiple YouTube channels like Sniper Wolf espanol Sniper Wolf Arabic and Sniper Wolf Franz and what does she post on these channels you ask not new content but a compilation and translations of the already existing Sniper Wolf YouTube Channel videos which they created together and still belong to channel red so naturally Evan should get his 50% share of the money but have you met celes and we aren't talking about Pocket Change here y'all these additional channels have collectively raked in over 1.25 million OMG you guys are you kidding me and to think that celes would just stroll in to read scripts after Evan had done all the research and Drafting and he'd still film direct edit and upload the videos the audacity remember guys all this is unfolding right in the middle of their divorce so according to Evan celes went ahead to create and run these channels without his consent with the aim of pulling viewers from the original sniperwolf channel that they jointly owned which would in turn reduce the income they should be sharing equally meanwhile she gets to enjoy 100% of the earnings from the new channels and so far she's bagged over a million dollar you guys and just when you thought it couldn't get any worse than it already is these two just keep sinking deeper in the mud slash still had more tricks up her sleeve she not only withheld information and access to these channels from Evan but she also refused to share the money as agreed she even locked Evan out of the channel red Instagram account but to top it all off slash took away his hard drives you guys who are we dealing with here sash has locked her former love in a deep dark cold bottomless pit and traveled all the way to the Bermuda triangle just to throw away the key so from what we've gathered so far it wasn't all roses in that relationship but they somehow used to patch things up however this time around it looks like Evan has had enough because in October 2022 he filed a petition for dissolution of the non-covenant marriage without children in Maricopa County superior court basically a divorce so there you have it guys this document outlines the seven counts that Evan is accusing sles of and man I don't know this is messed up super super messed up guys to be really honest though this lawsuit hasn't really slowed down sniper Wolf's growth so far cuz as you can see she's still getting really good numbers in her recent videos in addition to that she's already an established brand so she's not likely to go down completely but I don't think there's a YouTuber as problematic as Sniper Wolf however the big question is with the creative brain behind the channel gone will this affect her future when people start noticing that something seems different or can sniper wolf step up and fill evans's shoes so the sausage guy may have been behind the camera but he played a very huge role in Sniper Wolf's growth as a brand watching this unfold is going to be quite interesting and you already know I'll keep you posted loves anyways what do you think of this whole situation let's chat in the comment section and thank you all for watching
10/17/2023,Shane Dawson Almost Sued (exposing insane beauty secrets),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aphjs6P4I,197-11, Shane Dawson is back in the makeup world and also back to posting conspiracy theories and with that obviously means some drama this week he posted a video to his channel where he was putting several of his makeup theories to the test and trying his best to not get sued because the potential for that was pretty high with this one it's actually pretty insane what he was trying to prove in this video and maybe a warning to all to be careful with where you're shopping for things especially when it's for things that you're using on your skin and face I love shopping at the places that Shane is talking about in this video although he doesn't name drop specifically but you can kind of make it out when you're watching it if you've been there then you probably recognize it and this really is just a big warning to everyone I think but also kind of feels like one big lawsuit because it would certainly affect sales for them which is why he didn't name names but he almost did 4 years ago I mean seriously saying something about somewhere like this could definitely hurt business and that loss would lead them to come after him had he actually done that because I know that watching this it certainly has me thinking twice and feeling like yeah I'm never going to buy makeup there ever ever ever so as we talk about this Shane video if any of you guys maybe work at one of these stores like as you know we're talking about it and you're maybe like picking up on where it might be let me know how you feel or if you have stories to tell as we talk about this because what Shane decided to spill was insane so Shane said that he had actually filmed content for this video before Co but it was best that he didn't post it as he was already in some hot water with chu and cheese and his lawyer felt it was best not to post the video but now he's back to it because he feels like the message is really important and he's really going to try not to get sued in this video Shane said that he had a theory about discount stores in the makeup that they sell he said that he had previously tested this Theory out out before and it worked but since he couldn't post that video since he kept saying the name of the store he wanted to test it out all over again 4 years later and just not name the actual store and honestly I think 100% he would have been sued because this is just crazy they definitely would have wanted this video wiped from the internet because this information for this to get out it's sounding like illegal it's sounding bad it's sounding nasty is what it is but Shane is claiming that certain discount stores will allegedly sell used makeup to customers and that if someone buys a makeup product from the store and return it they'll just put the makeup back on the Shelf to sell again and it seems like they're not even checking to see if that makeup has been untouched like they are just putting it back nasty nasty status and that last time he tested this he bought a makeup product opened it marked it on the inside with a star so he could prove that it was the same one that he had bought last time and then he returned it went back the next day and the product that he had returned was back on the the Shelf like he bought it again to make sure and sure enough the same one with the star on it marked up had been on the Shelf sold again which means literally he could have done anything to this makeup product and they would have put it back onto the shelf and people are nasty some people are really nasty and disgusting and you just don't know what people are doing with their hands or what you know you just like don't know you don't know what people are doing so for them to put that back on the Shelf is crazy behavior he said he had also gotten other people in other states to test out the theory that he had and they also had the same experience where the product that they bought and returned was later put back on the Shelf to be sold again makeup products you guys products that are supposed to be for your face your eyes your skin oh my gosh and Shane FaceTime Jeffrey at one point in this video and he flat out confirmed that this is 100% something that stores like this do where they sell bad makeup to customers so the theory that when you return makeup maybe it gets sold to a discount makeup store where people are actually buying used makeup makeup is this something that you well I'm going to I'm going to let you have a doozy right off the bat I can confirm that is correct oh my God no wait last time you said you couldn't confirm it what what happened I have visited places and I've seen it happen from other companies so I feel comfortable being like absolutely and I've even seen stores take returns that customers have taken home doing God knows what and putting it back on the shelves and wiping the fingerprints off he said this is why he likes shopping online because he knows it's coming from a warehouse Jeffrey had even detailed how one of his products that was expired ended up in one of these stores saying that something happened with storing one of his teal lip products and they had gone bad so they sent them off to get destroyed but the company that was Trucking them off to be destroyed sold them off to one of these stores and Jeffrey ended up seeing his products on the shelf and so when he saw it he alerted the store and told them to pull the products immediately because they were expired they weren't good good so this is just a giant warning that they were giving in this video that you never know what you're getting there and where they got it from Jeffrey was saying that the store didn't even know that Jeffrey's products were expired since they bought it from the trucking company and they were trying to make it seem like they were working with Jeffrey in order to do this deal but even if these stores don't know the condition of the products that are on the shelf that definitely means you don't know and that is scary and the thing about these stores is they probably don't even want to know the condition of these products at least not the people at the top that are counting their dollars they probably don't care how that dollar is coming into their hand as long as they're getting that dollar but that's the problem and that was a big conversation in this video was that the people at the top don't care about the customer and they should because when safety is involved like you should care about customer safety this is something that is so effed up and it's dangerous and it should not be happening there should definitely be some sort of rules put in place where you can't do this but Jeffrey said after this experience they ended up changing their protocols on how they get rid of things and they take their damaged makeup and expire things to a different place now and they drive the trucks themselves so no Shady deals are happening but this is obviously so crazy and scary I mean how unsanitary is this which is exactly why Shane wanted to make this video in the first place because he wanted to warn people about this happening and felt like it was dangerous to be doing this which it is and he had hoped that they would have changed after Co because like I said he tried to do this video four years ago he tested it and you know he was proven correct in his Theory but he was hoping that after Co maybe they've been a little bit more careful because a lot of people in places got a lot more careful about germs and all of that after Co but things didn't exactly change Shane Ryland and his podcast co-host Lizzy went to the store bought some makeup and went home to inspect it they decided they were going to mark up some of the products they bought and kind of mess them up a little bit so they could identify them as the ones that they bought specifically and then returned them to see if they would be put back on the Shelf after they were returned cuz I want to be very sanitary and safe so which palette should we mess with and then return I'm going to make it very obviously used to a point where an employee or somebody there would be like don't put that on the Shelf it's pretty crazy I mean that looks like a toddler got to it is I'm going to Mark the Box inside so that tomorrow we can go back and see if they put it on the Shelf oh so a little sty see I mean if they accepted this that would be crazy well I think part of the returning process you're like this one was busted when I got home okay so I'm going to mark inside of this they did end up going back the next day and the makeup really was there on the Shelf you guys the ones that they bought and touched from the day before were on the Shelf again I found the same palette but I don't know if it's the one the palette okay and I drew a star inside I'm just going to rip it okay one two three oh my [Music] god oh cuz yes no sick they put back the broken one no okay this is actually a problem this is out of control star no when I went into the store and I saw the Sephora palette on the Shelf it was put right in front of the broken pallet okay I don't know if this is it I know they have multiple of these oh my God oh my God no way it's so insane it's so gross honestly that this is the case I think it definitely shows know people that they need to be careful with what they're buying from where because you just never know and you could end up paying more at the end of the day like I know like the best thing about these tours is that everything is cheap or cheaper than you would be paying for something like full price like I said I freaking shop there like I'm literally holding a lip balm in my hand you guys that I got at one of these stores but it's like you just don't know like the fact that someone could have bought that before you touched it done some nasty stuff to it and at the end of the day you could be paying more because God forbid you land in the hospital or something happens to your eye you're having to pay for a medication to treat pink eye or a sty or something you know like you would be paying more at the end of the day just try to buy from a safe place or you know if you are shopping from these places like just buy clothes from these places you guys cuz seriously it is just this is this is nasty you don't want to be worried about where your makeup or lotions or face products or nothing you don't want to be worried about where that came from I know the majority no products end up at these stores due to places is ordering too much stock or stores shutting down and they need a place for their products to go and I'm sure that's true for some of these products there but to not know the shelf life of something or if someone had previously bought it is crazy and this is something I don't think anyone really wanted to be the case here but there really should be proper rules put in place for these products being returned and Shane wasn't trying to blame employees here cuz obviously they're just doing what they're told this is clearly a company thing and it's just wild and and I wonder if they do this with other products too this is something that they talked about in this video but stores like these they sell food too okay they've got like snacks and gummies and you know all these seasonal things and pastas they sell jams you know sauces olive oils all that stuff I am wondering you know if people buy them and return them if food products go back on the Shelf cuz that is disgusting to think about but I'm thinking about it because of the makeup so that was the big thing in this video he also tested some of other theories like to see if travel siiz mascara was a better product than the fullsize version to make you want to buy the bigger one more and also revealed L'Oreal owning YSL and feeling like their $45 viral lip product was the same formula as the L'Oreal drug store product that was a dollar or something feeling like it wasn't just a good dupe but the same exact thing the formula and I must say it did look the same to me but obviously you got to look at the ingredients to prove something like that and same with the mascara but those were the other things that he talked about in this video this store you know getting exposed that was the big thing that was the thing that JW on the floor honestly that's nasty it was giving Chuck-E-Cheese level shock and I do feel like people might just go out there and try and test this out just like how people went to Chuck-E-Cheese and we're trying to see if their pizzas were going to like fit because Shane had made his video I could see people trying to test this little Theory like they once did with that but seriously they really need to either change their makeup return policy or they need to make sure that makeup is being destroyed if it is returned because that is disgusting like I said but like I mentioned earlier if any of you maybe got an idea of what store this is no you didn't cuz I didn't say it please don't sue me but if any of you guys maybe work at one of these stores like you don't have to like name the store obviously but like what is the policy please let us know the tea in the comments what is the deal and also if this is something that you didn't know and you shop here guys what are you feeling cuz it is making me a just at the thought but let me know what you guys think in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye [Music] guys
09/01/2023,This Is The WORST Family Channel On YouTube..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEZvU8a8MsA,193-11, the MC5 circus is a great channel to watch for tips on how to exploit your kids for views this is probably one of the worst family channels to ever exist on YouTube and it's only a matter of time before people call the parents out according to their YouTube details the family of five include Kelly the mom Jordan Isabel Lil Mama Preston Butters and helmet guy dad and right from the kids nicknames you can tell that the adults in the house are a bit twisted out of all the cool names they could have picked for Isabelle they went with little mama can you believe it but you might be thinking uh Anna that's not such a bad name well it gets worse they felt that Lil Mama wasn't sassy enough so they started calling her it guys I kid you not anytime the name it is mentioned in their videos they are referring to their own child that's its fault it's Fort the food itself but that's not all loves we're barely getting started this family YouTube channel has literally built its brand around this kid because she comes off as Lively high-spirited and in most cases unruly guys listen to what it has to say in this video this is my dead dog Barbie did she just say this is my dead dog Barbie okay for context their dog died a while ago so they got this toy dog as a replacement so in this video it is referring to the dead dog how is this normal oh and by the way loves every time I say it I am referring to Isabel AKA low mama and calling her it sounds quite odd but I need you to see the full picture furthermore this dead dog video isn't even the worst trust me when I tell you the entire channel will leave a bitter taste in your mouth let's save the content of the videos for a while and talk about something super super concerning and don't worry loves we'll talk about its other two siblings plus their parents it's just that they have made her the star of the show so we really have to dig into her online presence did you did you notice how it speaks I mean she sounds like a kid much younger than her real age this girl should be roughly eight to ten years old but she talks like she's barely three but here's the kicker y'all there's no way she speaks like that in real life because I did some digging like the modern day detective that I am and I found a video of her talking like a normal kid her age seriously where is it Where'd you leave it I don't know so again that little baby voice of hers is just an act before the camera rolls her parents say Hey little mama this is what we need you to say and please remember that voice yeah the baby voice it helps our videos get to a million views so you must use it otherwise we won't make enough money for food and to pay for this huge house does it work for them yes it does apparently that voice gives them millions of views [Music] to your babysitter I didn't do anything speaking of which it isn't the only one who seems to be guided by a certain on-camera Behavior this trend extends to all the other kids too because when you watch this video you will notice a shift in Jordan's attitude Jordan [Music] do you know where your sister is [Music] are you sure did you know that she notice how she instantly stopped smiling immediately when she rise the camera was on her face so two things guys either these kids are made to behave like this or like in this video they are simply tired of cameras on their faces every two seconds oh and by the way if you thought Isabelle had the worst nickname Jordan's nickname is babysitter yeah guys babysitter so for example in this video where it is apparently tied up on the balcony because she wasn't nice to the babysitter the babysitter in question is Jordan the older sister who is also still a kid it's clear they've cracked the code to perfect baby babysitting I mean why hire a professional when you have an expert in toddler diplomacy right in the family as we shift our Focus back to it who is literally the face of the channel you'll also notice that the parents have somehow managed to pull the stereotypical middle child role on her because she sometimes comes off as very rebellious and problematic interestingly enough there are also a lot of videos without the other two kids parts participating but it always takes Center Stage you will find her flipping around talking like a toddler or Mourning their dead dog Barbie on camera they actually have several videos of it getting delightfully messy and excusing her actions as middle child problems in this particular video it is being so nasty towards the babysitter but that's not even the worst part there's an adult in the background definitely the mother loudly gasping as it proceeds to pour water on her sister [Music] you should put her on the naughty list thank you [Music] your ice cream however the shocking part is is that their mother doesn't intervene she instead focuses entirely on it and in fact she even goes as far as to ask it if she's okay despite the fact that it's the babysitter who has been treated unpleasantly these two grown-ups don't mind filming their child's unruly behavior and unkindness towards her siblings anything for the views and it's beginning to take a toll on the other kids like in this video the babysitter wanted to quit the circus because she felt she wasn't as good as her younger sister foreign [Music] [Music] the Parents cast such a bright Spotlight on Isabel that Jordan her older sister feels like she's Fading Into the background Jordan's Spirit seems to be crushed and she'd rather walk away than compete with her own little sister thanks to parents who have quite literally turned their family Dynamics into a competition now while we can safely assume this video is scripted it's almost naive to think that constantly pitting their kids against each other is just for some clicks these are kids mind you you and their experiences will have an impact on the people they grow up to be let me explain their mom decided to take on the circus with Jordan to reassure her that she was just as valuable as Isabel this would have made such a beautiful and emotional video until this happened Isabelle runs to join in as Jordan and their mom hug she's been the center of focus for so long that she doesn't even notice she's stealing her sister's moment she even asked to do the circus with Jordan because there's no way she's letting her sister shine I know this may sound like I'm reaching because they are just kids but hear me out loves these parents have turned it into an intention Seeker who doesn't want anyone else to shine but her even the channel Banner only has its picture and a caption that says subscribe or it will eat you but that's just one way to look at it it makes sense that it is the most liked because she's literally bringing the bacon home they have actually played around a couple of times with the favorite Child title on several of their videos as I mentioned at the beginning of this video the MC5 5 circus channel is quite the master class in exploiting kids for profit but you see guys this is what happens when normal becomes boring people decide to push the needle and they will keep pushing it until someone calls them out on their BS if you really think about it would a normal family post these kinds of videos these videos Almost seem like something that would accidentally leak to the public only that in this case the parents are willingly creating and posting them I mean what happened to family channels sharing daily Vlogs playful challenges and travel Adventures DIY projects you know the kind of stuff normal people do moreover it's like the MC5 parents had a family meeting one day and said you know what let's be as creepy as possible to make matters worse many people not only have issues with their videos but their titles have also sparked quite the controversy it's true that clickbait is a common tactic for YouTubers but no amount of shock absorbers can prepare you for the mc5s level of Click baits look at this the title is so sibling even though we know Lil Mama isn't actually dead there's no way normal parents can play around with the death of their kids like that so yeah it just finished drawing and then she jumped to a mini bouncing Castle took a tumble and played out a fake death I love Nestle Crunch and do you know the mind-bending part of all this a staggering 143 million people have watched so I guess it was worth it it was almost as if the spectacle was worth every second guys I assure you I am not a hater but let's get to the heart of the matter which is the fact that it has been given this expectation that the crazier she can get the more views their channel will Garner and that means more money for the family as a result it does the most to get the job done even if it means faking death or mistreating her sister the babysitter let me put this in a way that'll help you see where the problem is it is being programmed to derive Joy from hurting and upsetting others or herself guys that is how bullies and psychopaths are made furthermore guys that video about little Mama's supposed death did so well that the MC5 family decided to create an entire series of other family members dying like in this separate video titled the baby is dead which got 105 5 million views so the youngest kid isn't quite on camera often but would you believe who they are referring to when they say the baby it's none other than the helmet guy their dad their dad yes he steps into the role of the baby which explains why he's sitting there with a bottle in hand instead of working on his streaming channel to get more views it's quite evident that these people are well aware of what they are doing because tell me why they chose to restrict comments on certain videos like this one but allow people to comment on others and remember y'all this is a family of acrobats their mom Kelly happens to be a certified aerial instructor well at least if we're going by what stated on their bio now this fact alone could have still gotten them so many views because it's actually so cool seeing that Silk that goes soaring through the air wrapped in those silk ropes and we have to give credit where it's deserved they are so good at it except maybe the helmet guy because I haven't seen him in this silk ropes once he's better off live streaming on Twitch but I digress anyways as for the rest of the family they are super good at it their stunts are also incredibly unique and the fact that they're a family working together adds an extra layer of charm I'm willing to bet my bottom dollar that even without unnecessary sideshows that make their kids appear as a bunch of weirdos online they could still Thrive as a major Family Channel at one point they even made an appearance on the Kelly Clarkson show as the model family that upheld family togetherness Fitness and maintained some sanity during the pandemic sane indeed but would you blame them because you might be thinking why can't they just stop the nonsense but then again how would they stop when they are a whopping 9 million plus subscribers early hitting that 10 million Mark and when each of their videos racks up Millions upon millions of views so perhaps the real question is why are people watching I don't know one thing's for sure though the MC5 Circus Circus isn't going to end anytime soon and it's actually very terrifying if you think about it it's also true that some parents some somewhere view them as role models and are about to break the internet with even more over-the-top content than this one loves I am genuinely curious about your take on this trend where families turn their kids into money making machines should family channels be banned altogether let me know down below also don't forget to click on the tab above for more videos on these celebrities and influencers
09/02/2023,Colleen Ballinger Called Out Again,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ0xIl4WyjY,186-11, the internet is not going to let Colleen Ballinger forget about the situation anytime soon it seems back in June the whole conversation surrounding Colleen blew up and several fans have come forward to say that they had been made to feel uncomfortable by the once popular Creator Colleen had developed close online friendships with her fans who were minors and had been exposed for messaging them privately and in group chats some of which have had their messages leaked for those online to read these messages alarmed the public given that she was a grown woman befriending children and even if she claims that she meant no harm people still felt as though this was wildly inappropriate behavior for her not to mention later she had been exposed for having sent around images from Trisha paytas's only fans account to some of the fans that she messaged making fun of Trisha which is again wildly inappropriate and also just extremely messed up as Trisha was someone that she was friends with and had collabed with aside from the messages people then criticized her live shows realizing that the jokes being made didn't seem appropriate for the teenage audience that was usually present and she would often ask audience members to join her on stage for challenges and such which led to an incident where one girl was made to feel uncomfortable and embarrassed but the way Colleen tried to apologize for the things that she had been called out for is not something that people are going to forget about as it's probably going to go down as the worst quote-unquote apology video in YouTube history and this past weekend at the streamy awards they decided to shade her video as they did in in memoriam segment and given that this is an internet award show they were going through some of the tragic internet moments of the year like Twitter changing to X and things like that but they wanted to end it with a special tribute to the ukulele but it was the tragic loss of this one thing that truly hit the Creator Community the hardest something who's trained unfortunately left the station with one ill-advised 10-minute long video I'm sorry no no I'm sorry looks like someone knows how to apologize seriously I don't think she'll really ever be able to recover from making that video after she posted it everything just got crazier I feel like more people were talking about her because they just couldn't believe that somebody was really doing like a quote-unquote apology video in a song and this was how she was addressing a situation that was very serious and when everything Amplified she wasn't the only one who decided to just stay silent because she didn't post again after that her friend Corey also went silent on socials and her brother and his wife also went silent they have a vlog Channel and they weren't really posting that much while all this was going down but they didn't stay away for long as they did return in July and started posting again her sister also has a YouTube channel but she never really stopped posting she's been consistently posting like a ways on her YouTube channel as for Corey though when Colleen was getting called out he was also exposed for having been in some of these group shots with Colleen fans he ended up deleting his 2 Twitter account as a result and hadn't posted on Instagram until now yesterday Corey decided to come back to his Instagram and he posted on his story and he also posted this photo to his feed with no caption and a limited comment section interesting photo to come back with I guess but who knows if this means that Colleen will be coming back to posting on social media sometime soon if everybody close to her is seemingly deciding that it's all right to be on social media again but I will say that with the way that her ex-husband Joshua is about to have an interview come out it's probably not something that she should be doing recently I talked about how YouTuber swoop had been doing a series on the entire Colleen Ballinger situation and in her last video that was four hours long she exposed one of the guys who had come out with information on Colleen named Johnny he detailed his experience working for her messaging her and also it come out to accuse her ex-husband of grooming him swoop uncovered that Johnny had not been very truthful in a lot of what he was saying about her ex-husband Josh some of it was like when he said that they had message and they had talked but things in regards to Josh being a groomer didn't seem to be true Johnny had doctored messages with him he was also getting timelines wrong and left out context to his stories and swoop has now sat down with Josh to give him a chance to speak out on everything including Colleen swoop tweeted that the interview was seven hours long and the teaser for the video was put out showing that they would be getting into a lot it seemed like Josh was going to be opening up about her relationship with Eric developing and there's been conversations over the years about the timelines and some overlap and things like that and Pauline has never addressed any of that but it sounds like Josh is about to reveal some information on that Joshua we have a lot to talk about obviously there are allegations that have been levied against you and we're going to get into those but you have also alleged that you are a victim as well a victim of abuse and that's something that I and my team take very seriously so I went from the boyfriend to the fiance that to the husband to now I started to feel almost like a character like I was replaceable she loved the attention she loved the status but do I think she truly loves her fans I never really felt like she did I think she just loved what it gave her she's having a few people over to the house and I was like who they said Eric and when I walk through those doors it reeked of alcohol and cigarettes and no one was there nobody was there and then I went upstairs and she was sitting on our bed playing her ukulele as I was leaving but I looked at her and I said when you're effing Eric in our bed I want you to think of me I've lost everything I lost my career I lost everything that I built so with this interview about to come out I just feel like Colleen is not going to be following in the footsteps of her family and her friend Corey of coming back to the internet at least not before all this is out and maybe once this is out she'll have to address some things I don't know as we've seen she's not the best at addressing things but who knows what is going to be said in this interview that was literally seven hours I mean seriously like that's a long time and with what he's saying just from the teaser it sounds like even more is about to come out about her but as of right now swoop has not posted her video from the time that I am recording this and it seems that this waiting game has not been good for Josh as he struggled with this entire subject still being a topic of conversation since he feels he can't really move on knowing this video will be coming out and that there will be conversations had once it is out he recently tweeted this interview has my head spinning I felt like it was the right thing at the right time with the right person it fell out of body some of the things I heard coming out of my mouth felt like I was shedding layers of sadness and fear I had been holding on to for years nervous he later said sick of thinking about how her decisions affected my life for so long sick of thinking about everything Johnny tried to make you believe sick of feeling like I have to defend myself or that I should just disappear again can this be over soon not much energy left in my tank this whole situation has certainly been hard for everyone who has been involved in it everyone who has come forward to share a story and we will just have to see what is shared when swoop posts her interview with Josh now in the teaser that she posted of this series it wasn't just them talking about Colleen he's obviously going to be talking about Johnny and those accusations more in depth given that there were those serious claims made against him and this has really been his chance to speak out about everything since I think the only place that he's really talked about this has been just on his Twitter account Johnny has accused you of some very serious allegations he is accused you of grooming him do you agree with that characterization of you no no at first it was felt normal and chill to have like oh that's Johnny he's at the show I didn't know that that was going to be time and time and time again that he would continuously show up at these shows he's out there dragging my name publicly calling me a little everyone's like poor Johnny I can't believe Josh just abandoned you and I'm like who Do You Think You Are my life was wrecked so we will just have to see when swoop does drop this video but as of right now that's what's come out and what has been recently going on with everyone involved in the situation I will certainly keep you guys updated as to what is going on especially once this video does come out swoop and her team put a lot of care and effort into these videos and they are very thorough with what they do so I can imagine that we are about to go on a ride with this next video but that's all as of right now I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music]

this coming that's right loves our beloved mukbanger has decided that it's time for a new chapter in his life and we're here for it so every time you hear the name nicocado avocado or when you bump into his channel for the first time you'll already get one Vibe you know insane amounts of food food and even more food his YouTube channel content has earned him followers and haters in equal measure with most people judging his lifestyle choices and extremely irrational attitude I mean nicocado avocado can start crying or cursing in the middle of a mukbang video unprovoked anyways y'all if you enjoyed his past videos you better hold on to those memories because going forward it looks like nicocado has had enough fun with that kind of food content and is now deliberately choosing healthier lifestyle choices he recently published a video titled how much I weigh now where he answers my questions from fans and also talked about losing almost 100 pounds and y'all the transformation is super awesome because it's actually showing you won't believe how seemingly fast he's been able to tone his body something y'all know isn't easy at all well even in that video he's still doing his usual mukbang but that's besides the point and what caught people's attention here was what he had to say about the weight loss journey and loves I can say that nicocado knows his stuffer on food nutrition and diet she would be surprised okay without further Ado let's just jump right into the part where he answers questions guess what nicocado even has a professional personal trainer which explains why he's so informed on nutrition matters he started by cautioning his viewers against falling for lies and unsolicited nutritional bits of advice that influencers and self-proclaimed Wellness experts pedal just to sell their ebooks do you know how common it is for people to do it I've always been able to tell because I had a personal trainer it's obvious when people are taking the juice or micro dosing or you know taking some growth hormones and it gives these weird expectations to people like oh I should look like that if I go to the gym for two years you won't look like that they are lying to you to sell you their ebooks nicocado mentioned that people grow less and less enthusiastic about making healthy life choices because of the unreasonable expectations they put on themselves and fail to attain apart from that he also mentioned a very important piece of information that people always tend to forget genetics play a major role in your physical appearance even when you stick to the best and healthiest diet rules and hit the gym to be honest we need to see more of this new version of nicocado especially in the digital era where we are obsessed with snatched wastes and being Picture Perfect it's hot as heck you know it cool oh oop it looks like the only thing that cicado has lost his weight and not his over-the-top personality and charm there's no way he's letting go of his Larger than Life Persona moreover it's interesting to hear his views on people's obsession with counting calories I don't count calories I like to say it because I know all you people care about everyone cares about cow I don't care about calories I don't he said unlike most people he's never been obsessed with counting calories because it's literally not practical to weigh food every single time you want to cook or eat guys if there's a video that proved nicocado's high IQ then this was it when they measure those calories let's say a banana as it's ripening the chicken fruit can be picked too early fruit can be grown in um not best sunlight so it has less sugar if there's less sugar then there's less calories every piece of fruit will taste a little bit different I mean that's just fruit you further remember that our bodies also absorb food so even if you you consume the right amount of calories you can't control how your body will absorb it listen to this the whole calorie thing is stupid and also do you absorb it like there's a study saying yeah you can have a handful of nuts there might be 300 making it up there's 300 calories in that Handful in itself but the human body can only absorb 125 calories of that 300 because of all the fiber it passes through you don't actually get those calories a calorie is a unit of energy that's all it is guys at this point nicocado qualifies to be a nutrition Guru who even thought nicocado would surprise us all with so much knowledge about healthy eating and weight loss it's truly super weird to see him educating his viewers on how our bodies absorb food differently and obsessing over calorie intake is pointless I'm sure he has earned the respect of many for shedding light on such crucial aspects of nutrition because they all know that weight is very uh weighty topic what a horrible way to count every piece of food that enters your mouth just I have to count it up proportionate some people enjoy that it's fun for them my thing is you just don't want to ever go hungry and I don't think they go hungry I think they eat so they're full but they're also keeping they're mindful of an estimated calories which is fine it's like he's become a nutrition ninja overnight sneaking up on us with these fantastic tips I actually never thought I'd pay so much attention to a nicocado video as I did on this one to the point that I personally did some fact checking about what he said concerning calories so yeah he's right the measurements and nutrition labels aren't always 100 so don't just trust Foods on the store shelves blindly while doing my research I also realized that even though nicocado was talking as an expert if you're just starting out on the Whole Health and Fitness thing then you really should consider the number of calories you take and it's okay to measure them within reasonable limits as a beginner it's important to keep tabs because you can easily forget the calories you eat especially drinks which explains why most people give up when they don't see any progress in their weight loss Journey so they go back to the same never-ending cycle of unreasonable body expectations that nicocado had addressed earlier the point is there was some truth to what he said some people take the calorie thing way too far but are people really surprised that nicocado knows all this in case you've forgotten who nicocado was before he started this outrageous mukbang Adventure let me jog your memory to over five years ago when nicocado was a raw vegan YouTuber he stopped creating vegan videos because of the constant hate he used to get from the vegan Community since most people used to criticize him for not being vegan enough or not using the right recipes I remember when I stopped being raw vegan and I got just attacked on the internet whether you want to call it attack words don't really attack you but people just coming at me saying that what I was doing was wrong when he started doing the mukbang videos you could see his pure passion for sharing food with the world a genuine love for trying new dishes from different eateries but it did not take long for nicocado to realize he wasn't getting the online attention he wanted that's when he switched it up to become a notch higher and ended up here he also threw in a bit of attitude to spice up his content anyways my point is nicocado has been doing this kind of thing for way too long and to add all of that he even confirmed in this weight loss video that he was once a fruitition I mean did you all know that sunlight can affect the quality of fruits a tree produces well thanks to nicocado we now have this information this is one of the reasons why most people are confident about his message in this weight loss video because he has proven that he really understands this Niche this has me thinking if nicocado had all these planned out from the start then maybe he created this mukbang eating character because he knew he wouldn't struggle to shut off the weight when the time came for that because it all the transformation is showing he brought up a lot of things about foods that we eat that we don't normally think about like the inconsistencies in labels put on food his main message in this video was that putting too much focus on calories as a means to lose weight is far more complicated than we think guys nicocado literally schooled Us in this video I am literally surprised and impressed at the same time a calorie is a unit of energy that's all it is it's heat are you utilizing it and are you absorbing it and Nicki's video 's video repetitive amounts of food anyway and sometimes get emotional and throw food at his partner you could literally predict everything including comments what if this genius move was an attempt to kill the boredom because it is actually working for the first time in ages people are talking about something new about him here's some proof this is the Nick we want we miss the lighthearted videos like this you enjoying food things like that and we don't hate you we just want to see you happy and healthy I'm honestly not mad about the fact that he's still doing mukbangs but I really hope he continues to keep this up he's gonna be one of my favorite YouTubers and I never thought I would say that as literally everyone else I am ridiculously happy to see this we love this version of Unico this is what we prefer to see we want you to be happy and healthy so proud of you keep on coming nickato because you've got us hooked and hungry for more also guys is it just me who has noticed on the cacado now even looks more energetic and happier in his videos he no longer is the emotional rude dramatic we all had been used to he's very well mannered in this video and I don't remember the last time I heard Nick ocado say thank you thank you you're welcome no thank you thank you for getting this for me I'm so happy since he was super creative enough to build a brand around the nicocado character who knows maybe it was his strategy all along and now the script requires him to turn a new Leaf we hope he doesn't lose his sense of humor though this is the first time I feel happy to watch him because of how calm he is and no ridiculous fights it's just amazing seeing Nick so calm and not fighting with Orlin brings me so much happiness Nick having a genuine smile just puts a smile on my face at first people thought nicocado was just a crazy YouTuber who would go to any lengths reviews But as time went by we realized he's actually very funny and smart and that there was more to his videos like many content creators he's just been playing a character and it really worked for him anyways we're glad that he's seemingly leaving all that behind let's wait and see what he'll be up to next thanks for watching loves and don't forget to click on the tab above for more videos on these celebrities and influencers
07/27/2023,Tana Mongeau Is In Trouble,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzDdRU3_kcE,176-11, Tana Mojo has found herself in some drama once again and it's not good her fans are accusing her of lying and she's also being accused of trying to steal someone's man so obviously as you can imagine it's quite the mess basically the other day Tana posted a tick tock that is now deleted where she did a little story time about how she was drunk the other night and tried to slide into a guy's DMS she said that she saw him on Tick Tock and thought that he was so hot and so she decided to slide in and say something along the lines of God sent me here he ended up having a girlfriend and Santa got called out by him and it turned into a huge drama but this man promptly responds and says back to God first class airmail you can't come back from that it is horrifying I have been thinking about it all day I could SOB he then says don't you know my girlfriend so that makes it a little more understandable and he's fine you know Tiana goes on to say that she doesn't know this girl and she was giving fan energy when she did take a photo with her I have no idea who his girlfriend is and then a couple minutes later I see that someone named Dura Castro mentioned me in her story she posts the DMS which I can admit is very embarrassing and funny Checkmate Duda she then includes this photo of us here's what I have to say I just said she snapped I don't know you I don't know you at all and we're gonna get into that this photo was taken when you invited yourself into my home and then asked like when I was having a kickback or something and then asked for a photo like it was a meet and greet your hot boyfriend's DMs I don't follow you and I never have every single time I've ever seen you DM me I said oh nope not today you fan dude I ended up bringing up Jake Paul which lets Hannah to say that Jake didn't like Judah why are you sending DMS to my boyfriend are you still mad about Jake of course I'm still mad about Jake no I'm kidding it's funny because back in the day I remember Jake saying that you had fan energy and lower run being I tied her up like I remember at one point it was like don't allow that Duda girl over and he could have been lying but I don't know it's still an embarrassing thing to have said about you weirdo Tana Ben size one of her fans found a receipt of a time where Judah had commented about shipping Jake and Erica costell over tana and him shout out to my actual fans because Tana's Rider on Instagram found this Gem of a comment why the the hell would I have loyalty to hey a stranger but B someone is commenting about how much they ship Jerica also you're so embarrassing for that so much more embarrassing than me sliding in your sexy man's dance and then you came into my house and asked me for a photo after commenting that why do you want to be in my house go to Jerica's house and I and I make it clear if I knew the man had a girlfriend I would never slide in on his DMs I don't like or want taken men but God I hope you guys have an awful breakup and he wants to one day despite you but this is where people are a little confused because Tana like she said in her video didn't really know this girl right she claimed that this girl was giving fan energy but people found that they actually did end up making a tick tock together before and it's on judo's page and they're kissing the caption was sorry Jake we hooked up at Tana Mojo So now the comments under the tick tock are questioning Tana saying now it's Hannah Tana Mojo LMAO you know damn well came here from the other video and I'm so confused what do you mean you've never met I thought you said you never met once Jana posted that Tick Tock Duda ended up responding in a noun deleted Tick Tock and decided to post something very long on her Instagram story if you're gonna use the situation for clout at least tell the truth for once we both know I've never been to your house but you've been to mine twice including for Austin's birthday where you wanted to film a tick tock with me to piss off your fake husband maybe you were just too drunk to remember I was never your friend and definitely not a fan you have absolutely nothing to add to my career or my personal life other than unresolved problems and hate spread across the internet we have friends in common and that's the only reason I sent you a DM back in 2014 but why would you show the dates to your fans right maybe you were not used to this kind of behavior but there are people out there who are actually nice you created a fake marriage and fell in love with a guy who can't stand you and because of my friendship with him you kept coming after me extremely drunk at different parties to have a heart-to-heart due to the fact that I was traveling with him and his family filming content including his music video and Vlogs anyone who got close to your husband freaked you out maybe you're the insecure one after all but let's not continue to involve someone who's happy in a real relationship which I actually have respect for she continued you knew very well about my relationship and this is not the first time you go after someone I'm dating it must suck to get shot down twice you do whatever you can to get what you want even if it comes down to something as low as trying to sleep with someone's boyfriend girlfriend if you want respect learn how to respect people's boundaries I can't understand the hatred you seem to have towards me is it my looks my friendship with Jake or because Bella Thorne followed me on Twitter is it because my partner shut you down publicly or because your manager approached me in the past interested in working together great guy by the way it's extremely sad to feel like I have to explain myself to millions of people when those who really know you know exactly the kind of person you are and what you're capable of doing with the life of a human being on the internet simply by views I admit I was wrong to post a video about you on my Tick Tock right after you posted about me I decided to delete it minutes later because I realized that I became someone just like you toxic insecure lonely and cruel and for that I apologize you don't have to have compassion or respect for yourself so I can't really ask you to have it for me but I would like to end this lie of yours by saying use your voice for something good or at least stop lying to your own fans you're a person with a big platform and you have the power to teach countless people especially women how to do good being known for mistreating people on the Internet won't pay your bills forever you play this nasty image online but behind cameras you're completely broken and alone who does not allow herself to grow and evolve 2023 Tana is time to grow up I'm sad to see the hate that was created based on a lie a Lie by someone who is known for lying so if you want to come on my platform call me names bad mouth the way I write due to the fact that English is my third language or anything like that I'm strong enough to handle it but I do ask that you respect my family and friends who are not public and are receiving unnecessary attacks because someone just couldn't handle getting shut down she then posted a screenshot of Tiana replying to everything that she said on her story in which Tana apparently said to her this is the most embarrassing I've ever seen LMAO it's sad to see that someone can't realize they started a problem like you're so above this and the victim oh OMG girl I'm so sorry hahaha die which what like piano girl What Judas also commented on an Instagram page that was talking about this whole situation saying that she has basically been harassed ever since Tana started talking about all of this commenting after being attacked all night by her fans on Tick Tock and Instagram which kept me awake I would like to thank all the love and affection I've been receiving for this post really I felt the need to post an explanation on my stories regarding this headless situation with the intuition to end this unnecessary drama thanks again for the love and I will say that people were noting that Tana messaged this guy on Instagram and his page has photos with his girlfriend on it and she definitely had to have seen them I'm not sure if she was just like to turn up to like see those photos and just went like straight for the DMS or thought that that was his sister or something I don't really freaking know but people were bringing up that aspect that they do have photos together on his page and that if Hannah went to Instagram to message him she probably would have seen it maybe she didn't care that he had a girlfriend all that stuff but this isn't even the end for Tana because now her podcast co-host Brook is also Under Fire right now after fans uncovered some old tweets of hers from back in the day that are said to be disturbing she's since apologized for them I will say on Reddit she's apologized twice now in the Reddit thread for their canceled podcast and she's also mentioned before that she's actively always on Reddit she's always looking at their page so I feel like everyone just knew that she would know that everyone was mad at her and that she had to say something because everyone's like broke please address this and she said in her post on Reddit that she's mentioned in the past that she had bad tweets before she's willing to address it again and maybe it will be addressed the next podcast episode along with this whole tanover's due to drama but one thing is for sure and that these two have a lot to talk about on the next canceled podcast I certainly want to know what you guys think about everything going on between tana and Judah and this whole drama literally just so insane I I don't know what to say I mean how does Santa get resolved in these situations and also you know I feel like she could have kept this one to herself and then none of this public like Instagram story stuff would have happened because I feel like now people are questioning Tana with the way that she said she didn't really know this girl and the way that she was painting this whole situation and now Tana is the one in trouble but then she's in the girls DMS saying that she's the problem so it's a whole thing but let me know what you guys think in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music]
07/17/2023,Colleen Ballinger Lawyers Up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LK0Ucm1Gko,171-11, at this point there's nothing good coming out about Colleen Ballinger and every time there's something new to update in regards to the situation it somehow makes her look that much worse basically there was some drama this past week with speculation as to whether or not she was trying to sell her apology song well I'm not even gonna really say it's an apology song because she didn't really apologize like it just felt more like a joke but her toxic gossip Train song became available for purchase this week randomly for 9.99 and everyone was kind of just like what like no freaking way and it was all under her own name alongside other songs that she has had on there from the past so it looked like she had put this up herself and she was selling it I mean it was so freaking weird you guys but before Colleen wants to get all crazy with her wires let me make it clear that her lawyers are denying this that she did this us before her legal team spoke out about this it wasn't a good look because people thought that it was her that she had done this it makes it seem like this is all more of a joke to her and also makes it seem like she's trying to collect all the coins possible during this time now at the beginning of all of this when she first came out with her video singing about the allegations meet against her there were theories going around that maybe she had decided to sing so that she could copyright claim people who tried to report on the subject by using clips of her singing the song or posted videos reacting to her song Because typically songs can easily be copyrighted so that theory was kind of being thrown around there there was also theories floating around about the timing of her releasing this particular ukulele video because she had posted it conveniently when H3 was going going on a break they decided that they were going to take a vacation take time off from uploading and of course Colleen posted when they were on this break they decided to wait until they were back to react to the video and things like that and that is where the drama just gets even crazier because those theories about Colleen possibly waiting for the H3 podcast to go on break to post her video only got bigger when H3 returned back and they ended up discussing the entire calling situation and Ethan ended up tweeting out that after their video was posted that they had been copyright claimed he tweeted out saying Colleen Ballinger uploaded toxic gossip train to CD Baby and is claiming us and he posted two screenshots that show that they had indeed gotten a copyright claim on their video and they were asked to share revenue and if you don't know CD Baby is a music distribution site and in the claim like I said they were demanding to share the revenue from the H3 episode since they had used her toxic gossip Train song in it and so once Ethan tweeted this people were like oh my God no way like this is actually crazy she looks so bad for doing this but the thing that had me sort of questioning if it was her or not was because there was so many people who had uploaded videos on her and it seems like only Ethan had been claimed like nobody else was coming out and saying that their video had been copyright claimed like there was a bunch of people messaging me if I had been copyright claims because I most definitely used clips from her ukulele song in videos that I made covering all the Colleen situation and I hadn't seen anything so I was just like something seems like really weird about this because if one person is getting copyright claims then most of us should have been because it just seemed like that would make more sense so it was just really weird and I mean Colleen is in some major trouble for making some seriously disturbing decisions throughout her career but I just couldn't imagine that she would want to ruin herself that much more than she already has by claiming people's videos and trying to sell her song like I know that she has made some very very terrible decisions and making that ukulele song was definitely one of those very terrible decisions but the idea that she would claim people's videos and try to sell her song I was just like literally like that would be the dumbest thing for her because she looks so bad it just looks like she's trying to stop people from reporting on her if that were to be the case and Ethan also is a little skeptical of whether or not it was her actually doing this they talked about it in the recent H3 episode and some had made notes about the fact that it is possible that someone could have uploaded the song on her behalf and just made it look like she had done it but I will say that Colleen has seemingly lawyered up and they are trying to shut down the theories that she tried to sell her song and copyright claim Ethan along with claims that she put her song on these Platforms in a statement to BuzzFeed they wrote Miss Ballinger did not upload the song or video to Apple music or to any other streaming platform for sale or for any other purpose we don't know how it got published on those platforms it was done without Miss Ballinger's knowledge or authorization and we have taken measures to have it removed they went on likewise Miss Ballinger has not issued any copyright infringement claims on videos featuring the song nor hushy monetized the video that was also a theory that was going around because Colleen's video was 10 minutes long people were wondering if she had sung the song to be 10 minutes in order to monetize the video I will say that a video only has to be eight minutes for it to be monetized or like to have a mid-roll now so I'm just like I just knew that that one wasn't really true that it was 10 minutes because of that I did get an ad when I was watching it though so I don't know but her lawyers are claiming that she did not monetize the video her lawyers are claiming that she did not try to copyright claim the video and her lawyers are also claiming that she did not put it on streaming platforms and I do know that YouTube does put ads on videos that aren't monetized like it's happened before so that's also an interesting situation definitely doesn't make her look good if that was the case since this though I will say that Ethan has come out to say that the video's claim was eventually released tweeting on Wednesday Colleen or whoever was impersonating her dropped the claim it took a little while for the claim to be dropped I don't know what the situation was there it's still really weird and it's unclear who did it if it wasn't Colleen because her lawyers are claiming once again let me be clear that Colleen did not claim Ethan's video so I don't know what the case is but it's just so freaking crazy and weird her lawyers were taking these accusations of copyright claiming the H3 episode very seriously because there ended up being an account who reposts a lot of H3 videos and it's called Ethan's basement and it's not run by Ethan or anyone in H3 they just re-upload clips for fun and they had posted hey H3 podcast Colleen's lawyer thinks I'm you and sent me a cease and desist email asking for Mr Klein what should I tell them cheers my dudes love ya so yes Colleen's lawyers tried to send a csynthesis to H3 and ended up sending it to a fan account instead just like so freaking weird Ethan didn't know if it was real at first he tweeted that he saw this saying I'm assuming this is fake until I see it I can't imagine her lawyers would be dumb enough to send it to a fan Channel but if it's real let's go and then he confirmed it's real they want us to clarify that she did not upload and claim the music now what I find compelling about this is that they don't care about the all the other stuff right it's just the CD Baby they've established too far Not The Grooming not are the brothers well yeah I don't know I mean they may be planning on suing the kids instead I hope not but you're probably right based on the gearing up I'm seeing here yeah as this whole Colleen situation has been going on Colleen's brother and his wife who have a family channel have also stopped posting as well as like you know Colleen she hasn't been uploading at all since all this has been going on but last week they decided to come back and start posting Vlogs again and they've been receiving some messages from Colleen fans that are still somehow there and they've been liking those messages that have been saying very kind things like sending so much love to your family we've missed you I've been checking YouTube every day and today with my lucky day and upload sending your whole family healing and hope I'm so glad to see your family's Adventures so glad y'all are still posting and miss the drama I need at least one of my Ballinger fixes please give my love to Colleen next time you see her I miss seeing her and the kids please let Colleen know she's loved and missed a bestie she doesn't know she has sending so much love to the Ballinger Family the entire family I honestly can't believe that they came back as this whole situation is still seemingly going on but clearly they do still have the support of some people and it's keeping them going but as of right now that's what's been going on with Colleen and her family and what her lawyers have had to say about this whole situation let me know what you guys think because the whole thing has just been so strange but I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music]
07/15/2023,James Charles Addresses His Allegations (family drama +more),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFpaCWnXP9Q,169-11, ahead of his brand launching James Charles decided to sit down with Cosmo for an interview and they really got into it talking about his online Journey cancellation boys all of it and it's really messy I'm honestly super surprised that James is even talking about this but at the same time with his brand launched around the corner of course he's going to be doing press in order to try to get his name out there to sell this dang product but this article that came out was titled James Charles would like to be uncanceled please which kind of says it all in this James said that he didn't want to mope around and make this some pity party for himself about how he was canceled and things like that they jumped right into the thick of the controversy with James saying that it's his fault for his own reputation but he's no Pito or groomer or Predator but he admits that he made a big mistake later in the article they mentioned how not too long ago James was called out by several boys who accused him of inappropriate behavior they noted that death noodles had a Twitter thread at the time that kept track of people who had come out to accuse James said that death noodles didn't fact check every accusation out there saying the source of where the list came from was not doing any sort of research no fact checking some of the screenshots depicted consensual conversations between adults he says others were completely fake and never even happened the article also added Cosmopolitan reached out to several people who said they were minors at the time of their exchange with Charles one asked if we would be willing to pay and did not reply again when told our publication does not compensate sources for interviews but another former accuser wrote back via Instagram zien with a new revelation he had said he already privately apologized to Charles a few months ago for telling him I was 18 a few years ago and The Tick Tock I made that blew up the situation when asked to elaborate the person did not reply Charles team says someone did message Charles this spring admitting he lied about his age later James admits that he understands the power and balance at play and his interactions online and says he should have verified everyone's ages and been more sensitive to how his Fame could color the way others responded to him admitting that he did f up but in reference to people referring to him as a groomer he says I feel like that word is a very popular buzzword right now especially in politics and stuff but the actual meaning of it has been so misconstrued referring to the first allegation against him he adds the conversation lasted one hour I don't know this person I've never met this person nothing happened between me and this actual person so to use that word is so categorically Incorrect and something I don't think that James has ever said before but he admitted in this interview that that because of everything that has come out about James and talking to minors and things like that his younger brother actually stopped talking to him and they haven't spoken in two years and this is really something I don't think that James has ever talked about before I mean it's something that is shocking to me because James does seem really close with his parents he's always flying home I mean he recently did a video showing off his childhood home and he was talking about him and his brother or their memories and all this stuff and so to find out that because of all this him and his brother haven't spoken in two years it's really crazy now when James was talking about dating and the struggles of it that led him to using Tick Tock in Instagram as a dating app he said quickly please name five famous male gay celebrities from the ages of 20 to 25 he says you can't because they don't exist now this quote has since been floating around online with people that disagree with James here they feel like there are a lot of 20 to 25 famous gay celebrities out there for James to connect with and also James doesn't have to be with a famous person it's there's a lot of things here that you know it's just I know that James wants someone that's at his level like I'm sure that it's hard to find someone that's ready to settle down and be in a house at the age of 20 to 25 like it's a very particular lifestyle that he lives where he's very much already settled and he's financially secure and all that stuff but this quote definitely had people like James that's not true that's not true I can imagine it's difficult to date when you are James Charles not only because of his reputation but because he is famous and he is settled and all that stuff but there's a lot of people that are like James I'm sure if you went like through the proper Outlets you could probably find someone I'm not sure but he does get into that whole city situation he goes on to say that his mistakes in the past were being too available and Reckless hitting on anyone being you know very desperate and he says that his intentions were never to prey on minors he just wanted a boyfriend and he still just wants love someone to care for him but it's hard and he was asked why he doesn't just use traditional dating apps like hinge or Tinder and things like that but he claims that he feels too Exposed on apps like that and people are just going to screenshot their messages and send them to their friends and put it online and he says that he now requires people to send their IDs before talking to them romantically whether it's in the DMS or things like that and that he actually did catch someone who was 17 that tried to like Photoshop their ID earlier this year and you know try to say that they were 18 when they were not and he clocked it and he referenced himself as like a club bouncer at this point because he has been asking for those IDs but in reference to this I will say that you know in James's experience people that talk to him in the DMS they screenshot his messages anyway and I also just feel like you know that's a very big sign of their character if they're going to be like screenshotting messages with James then you know kind of filters it out it's like hey that guy he's trash you know he was just using you because you're famous and he wanted to screenshot your pictures but if you're on a dating app it definitely looks less bad when something like that happens because you at least know that that person is of age or he's supposed to be of age and then it's on the app that they did not clock that that person was lying about their age it's not on James you know I feel like he would be safer his reputation would be safer if he was just on the Zam apps do you know what I mean you guys like if he is on hinge or he is on Grindr or he is on whatever app Tinder all of those apps if he is messaging someone and that person decides to screenshot their messages and put it online you know at least James knows that person is trash or whatever and we all know that they were talking on a proper dating app you know I just think it looks really bad when it's on Instagram and then it comes out that they're like 17 or whatever I feel like there's more of a chance that he's gonna get in trouble when he's talking to people in the DMS than if he's talking to someone on an app I don't know that's just what I think but anyways he says that he hears people say that you know he got away with it or nothing ever happened to him and people just feel like he never you know face any consequences for what he was accused of but he feels like he did like events and companies didn't want to work with him or have them at you know their events for a while he lost deals monetization for a while but over time things have obviously changed people have come around to him he's going to events again he's obviously about to launch this brand and painted and when talking about his brand that's about to launch he says that despite what people might think this brand is all him it's self-funded no investors or Partners this has come from his personal savings and checking accounts he said that he didn't know how that rumor got started but I personally think that it has to do with Jacqueline Hill and her not being so transparent about morphy's ownership over Jacqueline Cosmetics she had painted the brand out to be her own saying that it was even a family business but when morphy's parent company had to file for bankruptcy those documents came out and painted a much different story seeing as Jacqueline didn't hold that CEO title after all and was nowhere on the Jacqueline Cosmetics employees list and she had only been paid for letting them use her name and face to promote the brand I think that once that came out people started to question whether other influencers and celebrities actually own owned their companies and how much they actually put into them but James is shutting all that down by saying that this painted it's all him now James is certainly hoping that this brand will be a success given all that's happened and he's clearly just starting this little press tour to get people talking I mean seriously James isn't going to be talking about his past for nothing it's certainly all to try and push people to talk about Painted and get his name out there again but it's interesting to hear James reflect on the past and also reveals some things that we didn't really know about he certainly feels like his life shouldn't be ruined based on those past accusations and is keeping his fingers crossed that people are gonna be out there who will put their feelings aside to give his brand a shot at the end of the day and you know give him a chance to prove that he isn't who the headlines make him out to be so that's pretty much what James had to say in this interview I certainly want to know what you guys think about what James had to say about ever everything that's kind of given him his reputation and how you think his brand will do as a result of the things that have been said about him over the years I assume it should be launching soon as it's the middle of summer now and James said that the brand would be coming out this summer so any day now we should get a post about what day this thing will be going on sale and I assume this interview coming out is also a sign of that happening soon but let me know your thoughts in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys
07/10/2023,What Happened To SIS vs Bro? (Update),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPdn7nsa74c,162-11, never in a million years would I ever have imagined that sis vs bro would make it to the list of YouTubers that we forgot about and I know for sure that y'all feel the same way since they were this charismatic pair of siblings whose childhood was nothing but thrilling Adventures shared laughter and endless memories for their devoted fans [Music] no wonder people still ask them if they'll ever post videos on their sis vs bro YouTube channel since their last upload two years ago sis vs bro used to be my favorite YouTuber I feel like it was just a couple of days ago I found their Channel and was hooked anyways like they say change is inevitable it's clear that they are now following their own individual paths and they aren't doing badly loves to be honest y'all I don't think people have an issue with this because they weren't going to be kids forever it seems somewhat awkward that they just suddenly stopped posting of course they now have their individual channels but they've never been seen in a video together in two years they are no longer the 9 and 11 year old kids they were in 2016. Ronald seems rather laid back but Karina on the other hand not so much and y'all things are thick on her Tick Tock in addition to these posts about her and her parents rocky relationship there's no abuse going on we're all we're a happy family it's always funny when I see circulation sometimes I see something pop up like how we get abused no we're all happy we're all uh normal people you know at this point it literally feels as though Tick Tock has some kind of Feud with her her first account was doing so well with over a million followers but it got banned she has since created multiple new tick tock accounts but they all just get banned and I'm sure this all took a toll on her because she has to start from scratch every single time from reposting her old videos creating new content trying to get her fans and having to explain things over and over again hoping to reach a million followers again but why is she getting banned so often is she violating The Tick Tock rules or something first of all Karina always has so much to say concerning her childhood having to be a child and a YouTuber she seems to give this vibe that things were not always as rosy as they seemed in those edited videos they put out in one of her tick tocks Karina expressed how she couldn't have a normal childhood or hang out with her friends because she had to film videos for sis versus bro some fans sympathize with her defending her and acknowledging the sacrifices she made for her YouTube channel it's so sad to see that she had to miss out on a lot just to entertain us and you can always tell that Karina seems to Harbor feelings of guilt and resentment towards her childhood and sis vs bro even though fancier is a cherished part of their own childhoods what was the point of it if all of these videos were not genuine shortly after they stopped posting on YouTube Karina took to her first Tick-Tock account and y'all know how vividly different she was both in person and the content she was putting out it changed well I mean people do change like uh not everybody's gonna be wearing diapers forever so people change is that like upsetting should I still be wearing diapers she seemed really scornful about everything she did as a kid and every reaction video she made was not so positive and loves that's not all it also looks like things aren't great between her and her parents in one of her videos she kind of leaked that she and her dad always just end up screaming at each other whenever they have an argument on top of the flawed relationship with her parents it looks like Karina is having trouble in school too in one of her tick tocks she talked about being expelled from her school she then proceeded to Snapchat where she explained the cause of the expulsion was getting high in the bathroom when Ronald did a reaction video on what happened to Sis vs bro he confirmed that for the most part they weren't always as tight as they presented themselves for us and that they never even used to spend time together that much Ronald made a couple more revelations in that reaction video guys they did not even have a say on what or when to shoot videos it was always their parents idea Karina and Ronald just showed up to act when the camera started rolling and we were now we were just like okay video time what's the video like we didn't even make the video ideas we didn't added videos we didn't make the video ideas we didn't like set anything up we just kind of we're there like hey guys sisters bro and yeah it's not like the bond crushed the thing and I also saw this one Tick Tock like this one video where everyone's like my sister said she was like making some video for me if you're like her own personal Channel she was like I don't want to bring the camera downstairs because that's awkward and everyone's like oh my God it's awkward now that's so sad but we weren't recording like when we were making the videos that our parents were recording us or they're like telling us what to say and we were holding the camera and they were right there like you know this is a very disturbing Trend among kids being forced by their parents to be YouTubers most parents motivation is always money but this isn't always a reason to blast their kids life online in the case of sis vs bro for example they were already in a financially stable family well I agree that YouTube made them great money I also don't think that they desperately needed it as if their lives depended on it but if you're gonna walk down and parents didn't tell you to record and you weren't recording because they and like they aren't telling you what to say or anything like yeah it's gonna be awkward it would even be awkward like back in those days and this thing refuses to do anything with you like that's stretched out like I love interesting how he just took this and thought like we don't make videos anymore because I refuse to do anything with her anyways Katrina doesn't seem to agree because why would she make a tick tock video saying she used to pay her parents bills and yet in another separate video she said that she only had 12 euros and 40 cents to her name for a kid who used to be spoiled with everything she wanted just to make videos she is obviously mad at her parents for not putting enough money in her account especially now that she's a bit older let's just hope that they've chosen to hold the money safely in a trust somewhere and that they will transfer her rightful dues to her when she becomes mature enough to make sound financial decisions but guys let's consider her age despite the numerous scandals surrounding Katrina it's important to consider the possibility that she is simply going through a rebellious phase probably this is just a phase that shall pass some fans seem to agree with me on this one said she's just a normal teenager but because her whole life is on the internet everything is blown out of proportion and made a bigger deal than it is I'm actually glad that she got older and got more Rebel Yes she'll grow out of it and then she'll be so much happier will they ever come back to Sis versus bro we can only hope so but for now they've made it clear that they will not because they've grown to be completely different as individuals and they really don't have to do videos together if they don't want to we did love them but we also loved their authentic fun energy I'm a different person from Ronald's my life isn't completely intertwined with Ronald is doing his own thing why I don't know okay we're not twins or something anyways loves I would love to hear your opinion on this situation down below also don't forget to click on the top above for more videos on these celebrities and influencers

07/08/2023,The CREEPY Details You Missed in Colleen Ballinger's Apology Song,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7BX3A1f8KA,159-11,the infamous YouTuber Colleen Ballingeris back and against better judgment shehas decided to shock us with one hell ofa half-hearted apology that will leaveyou both speechless or matter at herthan before guys the drama is at anall-time high just as the vileaccusations that were leveled againsther but that's not all her ex-husbandJoshua David mostly referred to as Joshhas also had his two sons to say on thisissue I didn't think I'd be talkingabout Colleen Ballinger ever again but Ipromise y'all this is a big one sowithout a bee let's get right into itloves for those who are blissfullyunaware and the ones who had forgottenabout her Colleen Ballinger hasjaw-dropping allegations about groomingher underage fans in the past few yearsshe never really officially came out tooffer any explanations or apology butguess what while we assumed that maybeshe decided to deal with this underwraps for summer reason Colleen decidedto speak about it in a video sheuploaded a few days ago and loves when Itell you that this is one for the booksliterally Hall of Fame material anddon't get it twisted it's nothing tosmile about she not only dropped a songbut accompanied it with a ukulelebecause in her wise thinking thisapology needed a tune and beats yeahclassic okay before we dive into thelyrics and what her ex-husband had tosay can we for a minute talk about herthought process for this whole 10 minutevideo I don't know about y'all but Iwould think that if you've been accusedof a crime that outrageous where minersare involved and there's evidence andyou took ages before responding I'dassume that you were thinking of thebest approach to clear your name and betruly remorseful because at the end ofthe day you do owe your fans anexplanation so forgive me for thinkingthat Colleen would actually takeaccountability for this when I tell youthat I was beyond shocked when I watchedthis video for her it was just one thosefun light-hearted videos that MirandaSings does and I'm not the only one whothought this was a complete jokehonestly my main criticism with this isthat she didn't actually address whatshe did and what parts are rumors I doagree with some of the things she saidmainly about cancel culture rippingpeople to shreds I just wish she hadgone about this a little differentlysince ukulele seems very insensitivehopefully she can put out anotherstatement and an actual apology and Ihope she can learn and grow from this Iactually can't believe this is real thesad thing is is that it's clear that sheput a bunch of effort into the song andanother fan said this is so insulting tothe victims this in my opinion is thegoat of bad apologies safe to sayColleen Ballinger has thrown her careerto the pitstrain[Music]Trace information[Music]but guys let's give it to her it's notevery day that we see a ukulele apologyyeah brand If This Were me this wouldhave been the best time to hire a PRmanager not to turn into a recordingartist well I have to hand it to herthis is the most original apology videoI've ever seen I guess she gets pointsfor creativity now can we talk about thelyrics of this masterpiece of hersbecause she did acknowledge that theallegations were actually true[Music]okay first of all in this short-livedsongwriting career of hers Colleen wasso determined to shoot herself in thefoot now imagine being accused of havinginappropriate interactions with yourfans and then you go ahead and use thewords manipulation in a response videoin addition to that there is enoughevidence actual messages from her tothese fans and yet she has the nerve tosay these are just misinformation frommanipulation station woo girl okaymoving on swiftly loves there areobviously different perspectives hereeven these messages about periodsvirginity and everything she wasdiscussing with these minors were out ofgenuine concern she has no right to comeon here all dolled up with vocal checksand musical instruments trying to paintherself as innocent when she was theadult in all these cases and whateverher side of the story is these kidsfeelings still matter as long as herinteractions affected them which is afact and that's why they're stilltalking about it what she's saying nowis that she's being bullied and canceledand that things are being taken out ofcontext book gloves some people feel thesame way too she yo-yoed between this ismisinformation none of it is true andI'm only human don't judge me for amistake so wildly my eyes crossed toyour miners if your weird eye asks youyour favorite positions or to spreadyour legs with the excuse of a fart jokeplease tell your parents about it herbehavior wouldn't be K as a familymember either so it goes without sayingthat Colleen Ballinger's apology didn'tserve its purpose it actually angeredfans and triggered many you can clearlysee that according to her she didnothing wrong she was just trying to bebesties with everybody during her earlycareer days and instead of takingaccountability for her vile Behavior heronly regret is that she shouldn't havemessaged or responded to fans as if fansdon't interact as celebrities andinfluencers every daymany years ago I used to message my fansbut not in a creepy way like a lot ofyou are trying to suggest it was more ofa loser kind of way[Music]other than not taking accountabilityshe's even opened herself up to morehate most people obviously had forgottenabout this incident While othersprobably didn't even know about her butnow she has made us relive these momentsand her tragic story has hit theheadlines and Colleen is once again thetalk of the internet and not in a goodway maybe she's enjoying this what ifshe decided to come out with the songand let the internet do its thing butsomeone significantly important to thestory has also spoken up Joshua EvansColleen's ex-husband he took to Twitterto talk about the matter and even gaveus more insight into who Colleen reallyis in real life anyone feeling hurt andgaslit right now my message to you isthis your experiences were real theproof is there your trauma should betaken seriously the proof is there youranger is Justified the proof is thereyou deserve better take your power backsending you love this Behavior was myreality anytime I spoke up and disagreedwith her actions and rhetoric during the2009-2016I was gaslit too I was made to feel likeI was always the problem any pain I feltwas an inconvenience and was belittledevery ounce of what you're feeling Iunderstand and in another follow-uptweet he wrote I have no desire to usethis as a catalyst for YouTube comebackit's not a safe place for me I'm pastthat my voice is only here to helpvalidate those that are hurting nothingmore I have no need to make money off ofthis that is gross and not in my headwhatsoever since they were together forseven years and married over one year wecan't disregard everything he says heundoubtedly knows Colleen better thanany of us let me bring you up to speedabout how Josh did the most in the nameof being an online mentor to oneteenager called Johnny they met in 2018during Colleen's bus tour Ashley wasthrough Johnny that we first caught awindow of who Colleen really was herevealed that working with the couplewas a nightmare and that they had to putup with Colleen's constant bullyingamong other unpleasant experiences hehas since moved on from all of that buthe openly spoke about how much self-workit took to get over Colleen Johnny alsomade a separate video documenting hisexperience with Josh it seemed like bothColleen and Josh had questionablerelationships with fans because Josheven went ahead to give Johnny hisnumber and tried to be too close to himafter that in his defense Josh said thathe was only trying to be a mentor whichin retrospect wasn't appropriateconsidering that Johnny was only ateenager when they met of course it didraise eyebrows while a grown-up would beso obsessed with hanging out with ateenager that much why was Josh giving akid his number and why did he make it apoint to enthusiastically invite him tomore events and even do YouTube videocollabs with a child because that is howgroomers start Josh later ghosted Johnnyduring his divorce from Colleen he onlycame out to address his seeminglyquestionable closeness with Johnny whenJohnny started making the expose videosabout the couple he apologized forbefriending Johnny and tookaccountability for the fact that Johnnywas still a kid back then so as theadult he was supposed to have boundaryJosh made a long tweet apologizing forthe whole situation before eventuallyleaving YouTube he took the blame forgiving young Johnny his number askinghim to tweet on his Sarah account andnot taking him seriously he went as faras admitting that his life was toxic andchaotic at the time and finally wishedJohnny the very best in life what wereColleen and the husband up to but yousee guys that's the thing they say theinternet never forgets so when Colleendecides to annoy people with this basicwashed out disingenuous apology she alsoopened the Pandora's Box and when herex-husband tweeted about it he also tookus back to where it all started so it'sinexcusable for her to come out heredismissing the miners she groomed in asong saying it's a misunderstanding whenshe clearly knew what she was doing andwas even called out for this you canunderstand why her little Sideshow was avery bad idea and one last thing loveswhy would Colleen care enough to write asong If all of these were false let meknow your thoughts in the commentsection

situationthrough a song while playing the ukuleleand as one would anticipate from thatdescription the video was obviouslypoorly received it just seemed like shewas downplaying the whole situation andthe severity of what she's actually doneand honestly I have no idea how Colleenis even going to attempt to revive hercareer after even more evidence has comeout because she will probably be in jailbefore attempting to make anotherhorrendous ukulele video now anotherapology video could very well be on itsway you guys because an old video ofColleen is resurfacing over on Tick Tockso this

lot of people are justtheorizing that at the time Colleen madeall of these things out to be somethingthat was deemed normal to all thesechildren and of course children beingchildren wouldn't really think twiceabout the topics they were presented andthe environment that they weresurrounded in I mean at the end of theday they were going to all these showsbecause they liked Miranda as a fan andthese children were just vulnerable theyweren't thinking about the deeper anddarker side of Colleen people haven'tseen things like this over on Tick Tockshe normalizes that kind of languagewhich is harder for a child out todiscern when a person with badintentions does it character or not actor not this was still a grown adultthinking and acting out these things allthose parents no one stopped itquestioned it or anything I did see thiscomment that talked specifically aboutthe shows that all these children wereattending one person commented how therewas no advertising for Miranda's showsallowing them to be PG-13 there was noadvertising for her being PG-13 andmeant for kids so if you went andordered tickets there's nothing PG-13saying or parental advisory which ifthat's true that could make sense as towhy these parents were unaware aboutwhat these children were being presentedwith at these Miranda Sings shows and isso wrong on Colleen's part parentsshould have consent and know what theirchildren are being fed with andsurrounded with anyways guys this hasbeen the ongoing stuff that has beencoming out about Colleen Ballinger as ofrecently I definitely want to know whatyou

06/28/2023,The WORST YouTube Apology EVER... ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y83ivhOSbIc,154-11,Colleen Ballinger just uploaded a videotitled hi and this was her response toall the allegations that have beencoming out about her over these past fewweeks this isn't your typical YouTuberapology video though because Colleenmore so is denying most of theallegations that have come out about herand she's doing it by singing in aukulele people are just confused andthey're calling her out for thisresponse video and they're just sayingthis was not it they're coming for herPR team as well and they're just askingColleen why she thought this was a goodidea to make as a response video amidallegations of inappropriate conductinvolving some of her young fans Colleena 36 year old YouTuber known as MirandaSings has been facing severe backlashover these past few weeks she's evenbeen losing sponsors due to everythingcoming out about her after initiallysurfacing in 2020 the accusationsagainst Colleen resurfaced in June ofthis year when Adam McIntyre a formerfan of Colleen brought to life allegedinappropriate conversations he had withthe YouTuber this happened when he was14 years old in an expose video Adammade allegations that Colleen hadallegedly engaged in bullying andmanipulating her fans coercing them intoproviding unpaid labor as well as someother abhorrent things there were alsovideos on top of videos coming out aboutColleen's behavior during her MirandaSings shows which people were justshocked to see people have since beenwaiting for Colleen's response or howshe was going to address the situationas the days were going by and hersilence was speaking wonders to a lot ofpeople as a consequence of theseaccusations Colleen has faced severalcriticism from all directions she's beenlosing subscribers followers and thingswere only getting worse for her as thedays were going by until today Colleendecided to upload a video titled hi itwas a 10 minute video and she was prettymuch singing with a ukulele trying toexpress herself for all the wrongdoingsof her past but this video was prettymuch being referred to as Colleengaslighting People all throughout herresponse did not align with viewersexpectations and her video is filledwith plenty of negative comments for themost part rather than directlyaddressing the issue Colleen chose toexpress herself through a song shementioned that her management team hadstrongly advised her against speakingher mind but she realized they neverprohibited her from singing she prettymuch referred to all the things comingout about her as a toxic gossip trainshe clarified several years ago I usedto communicate with my fans however itwasn't in a creepy manner as some of youwere insinuating it was more of adesperate attempt to befriend anyone ina somewhat pitiful way she admitted thatduring the early stages of her careershe had failed to recognize theimportance of establishing boundariesbetween herself and her fans and sheasserted that she has since transformedher contact and taken responsibility forher actions however she proceeded tocriticize the allegations against herconstantly referring to them as productsof the toxic gossip terrain that thriveson malicious accusations Colleen opensup by stating I've been going through atough time so I decided to take a shortbreak there are many things being saidabout me that aren't entirely accuratehowever whether it's true or not doesn'tseem to matter as long as it providesentertainment for you she proceeds tosay hello everyone I've been wanting toaddress a few matters online although myteam strongly advised against speakingmy mind I recently realized they neverprohibited me from expressing myselfthrough a song yeah and that's exactlywhat she did she continued saying forover 15 years I have shared my lifeonline I have poured my heart out to youand because of that I feel like I'mtalking to my friends the chorus of hersong emphasized the toxic gossip trainderailing someone's reputation chin jumpaboard the toxic gossip train but if youopen your eyes you'll realize it's builton lies and maybe the person you despisedidn't deserve such harsh judgment yeahshe just kept on repeating sometimespeople can make mistakes you just gottalet them know gotta let them grow butit's like as a woman in her 30s sheshould have known better and all thestuff that came out about her isn't tobe categorized as some little oldmistake I mean there were numerousvideos on top of videos where heractions were persistently deemed asdeplorable and that's why people arecommenting things like I've been a fanfor over seven years and I've alwayssupported you but these allegationsaren't just rumors they're actuallyevidence-based this isn't takingaccountability it doesn't matter ifyou've never had any bad intentions afact goes over intention always I usedto think you would take responsibilityin a situation like this but to see thatthis is the response is honestly sodisappointing Colleen's next book how tocompletely decimate your career with aukulele anyone have a better title allshe did was talk about herself and howshe feels LOL also I love how she'strying to make this look spontaneouswhen it's obviously calculated and she'strying to manipulate us girly dug agrave for herself with this one ColleenI actually don't know what to say shereally came up with this and said Yupthis is the way to go says a lot Ididn't think your apology video could beworse than silence but she approved usall wrong here there are so many waysyou could have handled this this was oneof the weirdest this made it worseColleen mistakes are not the same as baddecisions this is so bizarre I have BPDtrauma and other that I've been throughand knows what it's like to be heavilyaffected by your emotions and beingimpulsive but this is still somethingshe chose to upload and edit andcalculate I'm so so confused and thisvideo just screams passiveaggressiveness and blaming everyone elseI got no words this is literally thedefinition of tone deaf and manipulativeI'm actually shocked any sympathy that Ihad for Colleen is 100 gone one personauditing I think the sad truth aboutthis is that Colleen is gonna be fine inthe long run Shane got brutally canceledJames committed literal crimes and theyboth still got lots of used money

06/21/2023,Jeffree Star is Wild (opening a meat + greet shop),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-8aBk8Hql0,151-9,Jeffree Star is having a makeup and me  meet and greet like makeup and me from his Yaks with a side of a picture with him Jeffrey is always cooking up some sort of crazy idea and doesn't ever care what people really have to say whether it's a controversial makeup palette or deciding to become a farmer since Moving to Wyoming Jeffrey hasn't stopped pumping out makeup he's been launching products like he was when he was living in California but he also decided to get into the meat industry and after posting a bunch of pictures with his Yaks one day he sprung on his followers that he was also going to be starting to sell meat their meat some people were kind of horrified since they thought the Yaks were mostly Jeffrey's new pets since he had been saying they were bringing him so much peace and comfort into his life so to see some of them packed up and in a freezer fans were very confused but Jeffrey ended up coming out and clarifying that the Yaks that he posts on Instagram are or his pets and not the one that he packages up and sells to people in restaurants and all that and he has different Yachts that he uses for his new meat business so no I met a layer um I started raising Yaks over a year ago and I still have a 120 pets and the only Yaks that you guys have ever seen on social media are my pets any tag with a name is my pet people are so I think if you just don't like me in general you're just hopping on this thing today maybe it's Memorial Day Weekend you're bored but I'm like girl stop making up in your heads people are literally making up their own narratives your soldering this was chocolate and Buster no they're actually right outside the window grazing on the grass but now Jeffrey is combining his two passions and is actually opening up a store in Wyoming and I thought since he's been talking about this store so much that it was going to be a cosmetic store but that's actually not the case it's way more than that it's Beauty with a snack on the side maybe he'll even do like a little Costco Sample stand or something while you're trying to match your concealer you can try out a little Yak meat or something like imagine imagine he did that but in all seriousness Jeffrey announced the grand opening date for his store on Instagram and said he's also doing a meet and greet that day all right y'all it's time I said it yesterday I said that I would announce the date of the grand opening of the Jeffree Star store makeup and meat right here in downtown Casper Wyoming July 14th baby mark it on the calendar go click the next post and I cannot wait to see you all next month makeup and meet and greet what an experience he posted on Instagram this huge flyer that said the details of things the address that was going to be coming soon he said huge announcement my first ever retail store is opening on July 14th the Jeffree Star store makeup and me is one of a kind and located in the heart of downtown Casper Wyoming the store will have the full range of JSC products as well as the full range of meat products from Star Yak Ranch there will be exclusive products only available at the store come celebrate the grand opening and pink ribbon cutting party with us I'll be doing a mean greet of course whether you are a local or traveling from out of state this event is going to be incredible and I would be honored if you joined we are partnering up with David Street Station to have a live musical concert and plenty of yak to taste see you there people were a little confused in commented things like cruelty free vegan makeup but sells me how is a brand cruelty free but selling me at the same time time it's like oh no we don't do animal testing because that's a hard no but we do offer animal tasting which is completely in line with the cruelty free part must be hard being a clown on the side of all of this as well what a weird combo though makeup and me so clearly people were quite thrown off by the Meat part but when Jeffrey first announced that he was going to be selling Yak meat he addressed these kinds of comments back then it was a vegan makeup brand for a living y'all know I eat meat every day what have I ever claimed to be vegan no I'm on year eight of Jeffree Star cosmetics and I created it so it can be inclusive and everyone could wear it so I guess some people forgot that Jeffrey did address this whole vegan makeup brand but that doesn't mean that I'm vegan and I'm going to keep my makeup away from meat it's definitely interesting and certainly just a combination for a store but then again like I guess they do sell like makeup products at Target and they sell me at Target in like grocery stores and stuff I don't know it's funny when you think about it that way but it's like like weird with Jeffrey and I didn't know that this was his plan all along but actually back in November Jeffrey announced that he had bought the space for the store and was working on it he said on Instagram I'm so excited to announce that I'm opening up my first retail store you will be able to shop all things Jeffree Star located in downtown Casper Wyoming right in the heart of the old Yellowstone District this store has over 7 000 square feet and will also be an interactive space inside you will be able to shop the full Jeffree Star cosmetics and Jeffree Star skin product lines and also star yacht Ranch frozen meat Yak plushies and anything star yak related there will be exclusive makeup and merch only available here besides having several shopping experiences there will also be a section where you can come see things from the Jeffree Star Museum every few months there will be different exotic cars to come view from my fleet huge huge props from our cosmetic campaigns that never get to be seen and so much more you can come in and take pictures of so this is something that is going to be way more than your average store I mean 7 000 square feet is a huge amount of space and I was just like what is he going to be doing with all this like he showed pictures of what this place was looking like and to fill it up with just makeup and a couple freezers of yaks like there had to be something more so it does seem like it's going to be a Jeffree Star photo op type of place and it's just such a random location for him to be doing this obviously there's a lot of land there and it's cheaper and more accessible for him to be getting 7 000 square foot any type of building anything over there than in somewhere like LA or anywhere in California but I just wonder like who is going to be going to this how often are they gonna be going to this like how are you gonna keep this up it just seems like such a big project but it was originally set to be open in Spring of this year but now it is Summer and the time has come for him to open his doors to his Beauty meat market and Jeffrey is planning this launch to be a huge event he is asking other people that have businesses in the area to be a part of this big event that he is throwing he's turning it into kind of like a music festival type of vibe like there's gonna be live music he is hyping it up so much okay there's already a lot of questions you guys I am so excited now today was just a very soft launch announcement more details will come of course very soon the store is looking phenomenal if you've driven past it lately in Casper baby maybe one of the dopest retail stores in Casper history I'm so excited with the progress July 14th is official we of course are going to partner up with David Street Station we're gonna have an amazing band come play we're gonna have live music and there's gonna be Yak food all day you could purchase we're gonna have one of the best people in town make it Mr Corey of occasions by Corey um and we're teaming up with all the locals it is going to be absolutely epic you guys and I'm so excited for the store launch so come join us for the pink ribbon cutting of course I'm going to be doing a very long meet and greet and it is going to be epic he's also expecting fans from all over to fly in for the event telling them which airport to go to now I know a lot of the Die Hard star family is going to want to fly in I am so excited if you're traveling from out of the country or out of state the airport code here is so easy to remember CPR that's Casper Wyoming CPR now flights are going to be limited we literally only have two gates here at our tiny little airport and a lot of my team has already booked their flights in advance of course um family friends and employees are coming and this is going to be the event of the year and as much as I'm like who is going to this he has had events in the past where I must say I was surprised that people came especially when he was selling the yak meat he was showing this huge line of people that were ready to try his Yak me like Jeffrey has some freaking fans in Wyoming it's actually quite crazy say hi y'all yes let's go outside and say hi to everyone bedroom oh my God what's up hey y'all today was insane first of all shout out to everyone that came down to our Yak meat pop-up um it was amazing there was people from all over I was so this whole thing will be very very interesting to see how a store does for him I really want to know what you guys think about the fact that Jeffrey is doing all of this and how you think this will do for him business-wise like this just seems so random and the location is random but I also just feel like why would he do it if he felt like no one was gonna come I guess but let me know how you guys feel about it in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys thank you [Music] 
06/21/2023,James Charles is Upset (starbucks drama),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqjLMqwjqiE,150-12,remember James Charles pinkity drinkity era he always had one in his hand this morning you guys know I start off my day every single day with a Starbucks Pink Kitty drinking my first ever pinkity drinkity how do you feel give us a review pinkity drinkity well now he wants a little credit for popularizing the Starbucks drink and a bunch of people are arguing with him online about this topic this all got brought up because Starbucks decided to release a bottle version of their pink drink in stores and James recently got his hands on it and decided to vent on Tick Tock about the fact that Starbucks never paid him for getting everyone to try this drink I found it for literally there until this morning I was walking down the aisle this literally caught the corner of my ice creaming sister up at me from the Shelf Starbucks recently decided to bottle their pinkity drinkity and now sell it in grocery stores all across America where's my check that's what I want to know where is my check I want the royalties on this a lot of you don't like me and that's okay but I know every single one of you in 2018 went to Starbucks and ordered a pinkity drinkity because of me because of me this used to be on their secret menu but when I started talking about this they became so popular that they officially got added to the real Starbucks menu and now it is still to this day one of the most popular drinks that they sell and I get nothing literally nothing not a single cent They sent me a DM in 2018 thanking me for making it super viral and were like oh my God we should talk I obviously wrote back being like love you guys let's do a commercial let's do a campaign let's do like a whole branded thing fully left me on red and a week later they unset their original DM admitting that it was all my idea and thanks to me that it became a thing I should sue oh honestly I stopped drinking this a very long time ago because it was giving me explosive diarrhea and making me fart non-stop so anyway let's try it out shall we cheers to millions of dollars down the drain yup it tastes exactly like a pink Drink I hate that it's good now this isn't the first time that James has seemingly taken credit for popularizing the drink he stitched a video on Tick Tock before of a Starbucks employee saying mid pink Drink disassociating to the fact that James Charles invented this drink and now I make 30 per shift and he captioned it saying I stopped drinking them so long ago because one Starbucks refused to cut me a check and two they made me fart someone else ended up replying to James and said so embarrassing watching him go along with a lie that he invented it I literally remember ordering it in 2016 and being an aesthetic Pinterest thing he just repopularized it in 2018 and yes it actually was created back in 2016 and we'll get into it but over the years James has stayed pretty consistent in being the pink Drink representative and on impulsive a while back he also talked about the fact that he popularized the dream we did get you your favorite Starbucks drink I believe I got a pink drink this drink is literally on the menu because of me um it was you have you used to have to order this by ordering it was a venti strawberry acai refresher with coconut milk and water all right okay so is it secret menu it used to be but then so many people I just started calling it The Pink drink on Snapchat and stuff and so many other people started actually on the menu right that's what Danny said yeah it blew up and Starbucks literally DM you'd be like oh my God we have so many people order the pink tanks like we love you and I was like oh we'd love to work together or something and they ignored it no come on and that's done and that's dumb you you literally have proven that you're like a market maker now there's a lot of confusion I think with this because some people think James is claiming that he invented the drink when that's not actually true the pink Drink was a thing way before James that popularized it in 2018 and I know because I remember my roommate in college working at Starbucks in 2016 and I literally have this screenshot on my phone from when someone was drinking the drink and I remember her starting to bring it home after after this so he definitely didn't invent it two years later popularized for sure but in Ben I don't think so I definitely do remember it being easier to order the drink after James started talking about it though because they knew what the pink Drink was and you didn't have to say strawberry acai with coconut milk but some of the wording in the replies under his Tick Tock Eventing about this had people feeling like he was trying to say that he invented the drink entirely and that's when it turned into a whole thing someone said to him James if it was on the secret menu doesn't that mean someone created it before you and he said there's no actual secret menu I started ordering it by customizing the refresher and I called it a pink drink then they added it to the real menu someone from Starbucks ended up replying to James upset that he was trying to take credit or feels entitled to some credit for something that he didn't actually create where is my check I want the world this literally makes me excuse me that I look like a mess right now but I was working at Starbucks in 2016 2017 when the pink Drink was actually put on the menu and it was put on the menu by Lady Gaga so Lady Gaga and Starbucks came together and they decided that 10 of the proceeds sold by the pink Drink And The Violet drink would be given to the Born This Way foundation so no you did not make it popular and no you did not put it on the menu because lady how God put it on the menu and in this little video he talks about how Starbucks sent him a message and then later deleted it that's probably because they've realized believe a couple years ago Lady Gaga put this on the menu and here is the proof for my last video Starbucks and Lady Gaga create cups of kindness collection June 2017. see here it is this is this one's a violet drink that's the matcha lemonade that's the pink ombre and then that's the pink Drink and it says uh the new Starbucks cups of kindness collection features four Vivid ice beverages hand-picked by Lady Gaga so here it is up there is a new matcha lemonade the new Violet drink and the Ombre pink Drink oh and look at that does it say the pink drink right there it totally says the pink Drink and look at that Starbucks has committed to a minimum of 2500 000 contributions to the Born This Way Foundation it was Lady Gaga who put it on the menu so James Charles please stop now this whole thing made me want to go out and try it for myself honestly because I heard these came out but they've been sold out and I just forgot that they existed so I decided to go on a little trip to the store and see what these bottled pink drinks were like if they were actually like the ones at Starbucks and I honestly also wanted to know if they were going to be chunky because sometimes if you let the Starbucks ones sit for a little bit it gets a little chunky and the Emma Chamberlain canned coffee drink was made with coconut milk and that one was pretty chunky and that was a whole drama and so I wanted to see if this one was gonna Chunk Up or like what the deal was if it tasted like the one from starbeez and shockingly it was super smooth no chunks and I didn't even have to shake it for it to look like this and it tasted exactly like the one from Starbucks and it's so much cheaper like this was 3.99 and the drink at Starbucks for Grande which is basically like half a cup up in some ice is 5.95 so if you like this drink and get it often honestly this might be the move for you if you can find it because everywhere was saying sold out but don't forget to thank James Charles while you're there because he seems to think that he deserves some credit for this drink being so popular and for the invention of the name the pink Drink I certainly do want to know what you guys think about the fact that James is mad at Starbucks for not giving him credit or writing him a check for talking about the pinkity drinkity do you guys think that he deserved a little something for it or did you already know about the drink before he started drinking them all the time I definitely think that they could have done some sort of campaign with him because he was very popular back then like 2018 was his Prime and that's when everyone was loving him and I feel like he could have been in like a little ad or something but also back then I just feel like a lot of people weren't taking influencers seriously I feel like brand deals weren't being thrown around like they are now I know a lot of people don't like to say that influencers are the same thing as a celebrity but they kind of are like they hold a lot of power they sell products there's a lot of people that are watching them that look up to them want to buy the things that they like and at that time James was super big but I feel like it wasn't until 2020 in Tick Tock that people started to look at influencers as celebrities because I think that Charlie demilio and Addison Ray really changed the game I mean Charlie with a hundred million followers these are like unheard of numbers and there was so many people watching them and I feel like a lot of companies started to see that influencers really do have a lot of people that are looking at them and they do bring in a lot of numbers I mean that's literally how Addison Ray got that movie deal on Netflix was because they knew that people were going to watch the movie because of Addison whether they liked her or not and she delivered she brought in a ton of viewers but I feel like back then Starbucks probably was just like eh I don't know if it's like the right thing to do in influencer collaboration in and I'm not saying that there were no brand deals before like Addison Ray and like 2020 and stuff because there definitely were but I just see like a lot of them were still skeptical on the whole thing and I feel like they just could have done something fun with James at the time even though this is supposedly Lady Gaga's drink that she created in 2016. it didn't have to be like the James Charles pink drink but he could have just been holding it up for like an ad and I feel like it would have been like a fun little thing but it didn't happen and he's clearly still very bitter about it but that's what's going on with James wanting his little check from starbeez let me know what you guys think in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music] 
06/20/2023,Colleen Ballinger Being A CREEP Is Getting Worse,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcYJSw9DyPU,152-9,Colleen Ballinger is under major fire at the moment since she's not only been exposed for allegedly being a terrible person but for also being super inappropriate with minors the whole thing has been going on for years and Adam McIntyre whose life she basically tried to ruin has decided to try and expose everything she ever did to him and others and he is not holding back I do believe that she brimmed me I also believe she used me some people have felt disgust for Colleen over the years I mean some people even believe that her entire Miranda Sings character's only personality trait was to act stupid and gross and I'm sure that just made a lot of people feel uncomfortable and she honestly should have been canceled like a long time ago with how terrible some of the things she's done have been which I'll get into in just a moment however that's not to say that people haven't tried to cancel her before but it's never become this big of a thing Adam made his first video about the situation three years ago but unfortunately many of her fans turned against Adam rather than showing support his video titled Colleen Ballinger stop lying talked about how he had been a fan of Colleen ever since he was 12. and about how Colleen eventually reached out to him and began taking advantage of him for years he started off by talking about how Colleen first started messaging him and how it very quickly turned pretty weird very quickly we started talking a lot and my parents were really happy to see the fact that someone like Colleen Ballinger was so dedicated to talking to all of her fans this slowly turned into me getting private details about her divorce and what was happening with the relationship with her ex-husband around this time though was whenever my parents start getting a little bit more cautious and we're wondering why a 30 year old was talking to at this time a 13 year old fighter divorce eventually they leave the teen when they first started texting was to get him to find out drama for her that she could use for Content she was basically using him to do her job for her and not even paying him for it and Adam who really didn't even know any better since he was literally 13 was ecstatic to be doing all of this for Colleen since he looked up to her so much the worst part is that Colleen not only continued to use him in this way but also took it even further by asking to engage in Gossip sites about her which eventually led him to get a lot of hate and Adam the character the person whatever you want to call it started getting really attacked on these sites too now keep in mind I was only 14 at this time so then I was getting targeted on these gossip sites and I was getting called a pick me manipulative and other words I won't say just because my extended family are watching this video and I I really I can't I Adam's Family did get involved at this point asking him to stop engaging with her because it was starting to become damaging to him but unfortunately it was a pretty hard thing to do since he had invested so much time into her and she also just wouldn't let him go because y'all Colleen would constantly do small things for Adam like subscribing to his YouTube channel or leaving comments which made him very happy just so she could ask him to do more stuff for her and overall just stringing him along for her own benefit one time she even promised him that she'd fly him and his brother out to America so they could go to VidCon which shocker never actually happened Adam did admit that he kept falling for her tricks which isn't really a surprise since he was literally 14 and cannot be blamed because I was dumb impressionable young naive whatever I want to call I have so many names for what I believe I was I'd always cave honestly Adam also revealed that Colleen would always contact him and talk to him about her divorce and the trouble that she had with her ex-husband and so it's no surprise that this was some really heavy information to lay on a 14 year old especially because to Adam they were the perfect couple from her YouTube videos so I can't even imagine how damaging this must have been for him but probably the worst thing she ever did to Adam was the fact that she found his Twitter account so funny that she decided to send him lingerie for some reason this grown woman thought it was completely alright to send a child underwear they went on my Twitter because they thought it was funny and then they said they had to send me the bra and panties here are some clips from that live stream [Laughter] [Music] ing homeschooled Christian University real on this this is honestly the worst outfit he's so rude what made you order these ugly clothes bottom these those clothes are nasty he's so rude oh my God he's so sassy your Twitter guy is making me laugh so much oh my God that makes me laugh I want to send him something do you want the bra Adams do you want the brown panties tweet right now oh my God yeah Adam let me know what you want okay I'm sending him something okay maybe he'll want the panties although then his parents will be like you're not allowed to watch who's sending you panties mom don't worry I watched the boy wear them online first and guys she was not joking she literally did mail it to him and he still has it to this day because his mom had understandably taken it away am I doing like a haul for you I don't know and then I hate touchnap then these I don't know which way they go but these as well so I was genuinely still surprised that my mom had these and anyways Colleen didn't stop reaching out to Adam and even made him her social media manager at one point which ended terribly it all started off as him just giving her tweet ideas but it quickly escalated into her giving him free reign of her Twitter account um whenever we talked behind Miranda wasn't really doing well anymore she messaged me and then said well help me and that's them whenever I started giving the Tweet ideas so on the 25th of March of this year I started giving more ideas again because kaleem is aware that the Miranda character was becoming very stale and inactive on social media and on the 26th of March again she started tweeting my ideas which included Animal Crossing stuff so on the 25th and 26th I presented her with about 15 different tweet ideas so then came a tweet about Miranda Sings coming out as a Meghan Trainor fan which she was initially confused about and she says I don't know what you're saying about Megan so then I explained it again and Colleen was fully gonna go ahead posting it herself as you can see here so I helped give her the photos and the concept and she said when should I do that should I do that today or tomorrow before I post the video and I said what are you waiting for today and she says okay cool showing that she had every single intention to post this tweet on her own behalf Colleen offered him a social media intern position and even promised an hourly rate in the future if things went well now this obviously didn't end well and honestly even if it had it's hard to imagine her keeping that promise with her track record at the time Adam was of course super excited to do this for her not realizing the damage it would cause and he went on to tweet something on her account which he at the time didn't realize was harmful but it got her into a lot of trouble the Tweet was about how Miranda was coming out as a Meghan Trainor fan which was obviously badly received since it looked like she was making fun of the lgbtq plus Community this ended in Colleen getting mad at Adam even though he had asked her beforehand if it was okay to tweet and she approved it she was actually going to post it herself before Adam took over the account but because he was the one to actually tweet it she ended up being super guilt-trippy towards him and made him feel bad for having caused her to get hate and she said the thing is I agree with them queerbaiting is not a joke I'm super sad of upset so many people I'm telling you girl I'm super sensitive like near tears again trying to guilt me and make me feel really bad for something that she had already approved and find funny and she didn't see any problems with it I'm gonna be really honest for a second I spent that entire day just crying in bed and texting my friends and my mom and dad were just comforting me the entire day I was a mask that day I was completely radio silent on everything ask any of my friends from that day it was such a horrible day like it was so so awful I didn't even get a message from Colleen Austin who I was it was just guilt-tripping me that I had done all this to her almost as if I had planned it or something so she continued to talk about it she said it's all anyone is talking about I'm really upset I would never post something like that at night everyone thinks I'm homophobic I'm really really upset by the end of it Adam ended up being the one to comfort Colleen in this situation and promise that the whole thing would blow over and the worst part is is that she left him on red and that was actually the last he had ever heard from her so to recap Colleen found this 13 year old boy who was a devoted supporter and then started using him for video ideas send him lingerie made him her social media manager and then blamed him when it all blew up in her face traumatized him and then never talked to him again today A lot of people are questioning how she wasn't Beyond canceled the first time that Adam posted that video video but Colleen swarm of fans somehow looked past all of this and decided to not only keep supporting her but also to send Adam so much hate and she even actively encouraged this and guys Adam revealed that he had gotten sent some DMS of Colleen's best friend Corey who was talking badly about Adam in a group chat with fans and also telling them what Colleen was saying about Adam Cory was basically saying that Colleen thinks this one Twitter account that was hating on fans was Adam and telling all these other fans that Adam was now going around trolling and attacking Colleen and her fans because of everything that happened obviously a lot of her fans believed all that stuff and started accusing the victim in this situation of being the one to blame for what Colleen was going around doing anyways guys things obviously didn't end there as recently a lot of allegations against Colleen have been brought up again especially by the YouTuber Cody rantz who spoke up about their experience with Colleen and how they felt manipulated by Colleen Cody uploaded a video called why I left the calling Ballinger fandom where they addressed the relationship they had Colleen years ago which was very similar to Adams Cody joined Colleen's fandom and became a pretty well-known figure by joining well-known Twitter group chats and even getting close with Colleen's friends and family but Cody has come out now to prove how truly disturbing the things that were going on were in their video Cody addressed Adam's situation and how their initial reaction was shock and disgust my immediate thought was what Cody then showed a DM Colleen had sent them which explained her side of the story after she stopped responding to Adam where she basically said that Adam was lying about a lot of things and showing things out of context which he would get major backlash for if she were to expose him and said that the reason she wasn't speaking out was because she wanted to respect him as a minor and his family and that she was really sad and disappointed by everything and this was all an attempt to get Cody to turn against Adam because she clearly knew that Cody would make a video on this situation since it was everything anyone was talking about Colleen's that I now realize I never should have been communicating with him in the first place referring to the fact that this was a minor and then Cody pulled out some extremely shocking receipts like people were shocked he's not even the only child that she was talking to she was literally in DMS talking to Children about scx here's one are you a virgin this is Colleen in a group chat with children they're called the weenies this is the group chat you're in the coin Ballinger fandom you know about this group chat she's also asking what's your favorite position this grown woman was asking miners these things and was just now realizing that maybe that was bad Cody also pointed out how completely inappropriate Colleen was for children since her content was filled with things like this was it satire when you joked about this work multiple times was the satire of you joking about our wording your then husband was it satire you telling people they should are word your friend Harvey was it satar you joking about our wording your Young audience's Twitter feeds using the hardwood again and let's not forget the fact that she also has this written in one of her old thumbnails like guys why was she literally admitting that she is a pedophile anyways Cody then referenced the video they made on Adam years ago where they defended Colleen and basically discredited everything Adam was saying and admitted that she was manipulated by Colleen into making it and y'all Cody showed what Colleen had sent them as proof that Adam was lying which is her responding to his last text message that he didn't include in his original video but she dm'd me was so I would make this video I would make a video that would defend her and it worked and that's sad I was so excited when she messaged me I was like oh my God she's confiding to me I was gonna be her knight in shining armor right in Colleen's text she not only referred to the whole thing as Adam's drama twice but also flat out denied that she was talking badly about Adam when he literally had screenshot proof I'm not really sure how this was supposed to prove her innocence at all but unfortunately Cody did fall for the charm of having her Idol message her and played right in to what she wanted y'all I was trying to get her to tell me stuff I wanted her to like me okay I didn't actually know if he was lying or not I didn't care I wanted her to notice me I'm just being honest I was mentally ill and a person that I idolized was messaging me so I was just really in the dark like I had rose-colored glasses on I did not know how bad of a person she was and it's just really sad and I think that's why I was still trying to like be on her good side even though I didn't really like what she was doing to Adam I just really wanted to get the DMS for my video and I really wanted to have something else that other people hadn't had and I was the only person that she was talking to in the drama community and I didn't want to like mess it up and have her just like go away and not say anything because I was afraid she wasn't going to apologize and I thought well maybe if I get her on my side like maybe I can get her to say something I don't know it was a hot mess express it was super clear that Cody was too close to Colleen to have made that video something that they thankfully admit to now and they've even said it was a full on parasocial relationship I'm being so dramatic I'm so sorry that I was so Manic and wild and was in a parasocial relationship with this woman to the point where I was being mean to a literal kid but all that doesn't change what happened in the past and the fact that Cody's video had a lot of negative impact on Adam they literally texted Colleen my plan is to paint the video to show Adam manipulates you into trusting him and he had a master plan to take you down when you got mad about the Miranda thing and Cody wasn't a child at this point they were an adult and really should have known how messed up this whole thing is but at the same time it's also very clear that Colleen was trying to twist the situation into looking like the victim in front of Cody who idolized her Cody also exposed the fact that Corey was just as much in on the situation as Colleen was and he was even hate talking Adam in Cody's DMS which Cody claimed was him being manipulative so he could turn them against Adam Adam deserves to see this everyone deserves to see what kind of people these people are the only time I said his name was when we wondered if he ran the hate account this is the Galaxy Colleen account which I made a video on I wondered if he ran the heat account because for years people have sent a screenshots of him hating on us where I hate how he acted like I was friends with him but if he was a child so guys this was all Colleen and Corey basically trying to put the responsibility on someone else so that she could have people expose Adam for her so that she wouldn't get the backlash for going after a child but also let me just mention the fact that Cody's replies in some of these DMS are a really weird thing for an adult to say about a child as well and just because they apologize doesn't mean that it's okay to talk about Adam in this way like why are they calling him weird for being friends with these adults instead of the other way around anyways y'all Adam ended up reacting to everything Cody had exposed about Colleen since they were the first person to side with him after all these years and it clearly gave him some sort of closure to hear that it wasn't all in his head Adam also addressed the fact that Colleen's creepy messages to kids in the Wendy's group chat that Cody showed were actually addressed to him I never thought these matches would get out but that was to me these messages were to me in our group chat with Colleen we were in a group chat called the Weenies and I wrote in the group chat and said I'm doing a YouTube q a and I need questions and Colleen was like so this was like 2017 2016 so I would have been [Music] 15 or something like that 15-ish and I was like innocently [ __ ] me but even then I mean you know Stan mentality but even just on a baseline of how it went so I wrote in the group chat and was like and by the way by the look at this Adam Adam you need questions for your q a are you a virgin in the same thing to address the fact that because of the video they made defending Colleen and at the time he said that he actually forgives Cody for everything since they were too manipulated by Colleen and he couldn't blame someone for going through the same things that he did but y'all Adam actually ended up taking that forgiveness back when he found out that Cody wasn't actually trying to look out for Adam when they posted their video if you have the screenshots and you cared about Adam for three years why wouldn't you have given him the screenshots and and Cody goes and I quote these words that they said are the reasons that I take back ever forgiving Cody for what they did to me Cody said because it was my story to tell and this was all after Cody and Adam had talked about how effective they were by the entire thing and Adam had even opened up about how he had a hard time trusting people after everything that happened and Cody goes out there and posts that video to tell their story so they can get some views and get some revenge on Colleen and Corey and not because Colleen had literally the child and turned his life to Hell honestly I completely understand why Adam got so mad when he heard them refer to it as their story since the video was literally all about Adam and even ended up ruining his life everybody thought that he was a liar after Cody exposed him but thankfully the screenshots from weenie's group chat could finally give Adam concrete proof that Colleen really was inappropriate with him another thing that Adam uncovered is actually the fact that in Colleen's own video where she addressed the situation a few years ago she makes it very clear that she wasn't the one to send Adam the underwear and that he begged her to send it to him and basically just made it sound like Adam had lied about her sending it to him because she thought his tweets were so so funny that she could make it look like he was lying about the other stuff too but what really happened is that Colleen Twisted the video to fit her narrative Colleen fully manipulated the actual truth so that she could make Adam who was a child look bad in front of her audience this was also after Cody had posted their video which means that Adam was just getting attacked from all sides at that point and had no way of defending himself because he didn't have any of the proof that he has today Adam also had another stream with people who were also in the weenies group chat who revealed that Colleen told them not to watch Adam's original video and the reason they all turned against him was because they never knew what Colleen had done to him but because of that stream where the other members of the group chat got to tell their stories of Colleen and share even more screenshots of her being gross and creepy Adam started getting swarmed with even more hate and even death threats and doxing the whole thing got so bad that Adam had to get the police involved since he genuinely started to fear for his safety thankfully a lot of people have stood up for Adam after everything has been addressed and a bunch of people have also come out and described how they've had similar encounters with Colleen where she had made them feel uncomfortable and there have even been videos shared of Colleen being inappropriate with children on stage all it takes is a little breeze and I'll see all the bits so this is a very good example of what you don't want to address like so this is porn what's your name Grace exactly so first type of horn is clothing okay this is example not porn porn not porn porn yeah guys and these are just some of the instances and so many people have come out to share their experiences and thankfully a lot of people are seeing Colleen's true colors after all these years and canceling her for good anyways loves thanks so much for watching and make sure to comment down below what you think of this whole situation and don't forget to click here for more drama 
06/18/2023,Oli London Is DESPERATE For Attention & Needs To Stop,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGdeM80m1Io,149-11,get some popcorn and hold on to your seats because Ollie London is back in the spotlight with yet another jaw-dropping story and causing a stir like never before for those of you who don't know Ollie London is basically a wannabe K-pop Star who has become one of the most talked about people on the internet for doing some pretty shady and shocking things so why does he do what he does is it for attention or is there seriously something wrong with him Ali is a British influencer television personality and singer who became famous for his major obsession with Korean pop culture specifically the K-Pop group BTS I'm Ali London I'm obsessed with K-pop and BTS but who isn't obsessed with BTS Ali London's obsession is quite more than your typical average fan according to Ali his obsession with jimin from BTS and Korean culture began when he lived in seal for a year in 2013. it was during this time that he taught English and discovered the world of K-pop so with that in mind Ali embarked on a super expensive cosmetic surgery journey in an attempt to look exactly like his favorite BTS member Park jimin you look at the pictures we're identical really okay I know I'm identical no you're not when I was in Korea everyone calls me jimin when I'm walking down the street everyone's like oh my God it's Jimmy Jimmy all right everyone that's a load of crap you think I'm jimin Ollie spent a jaw-dropping 300 000 on over 30 surgeries over the next nine years Ollie whitened his skin and vampire facials basically whatever it took to achieve the perfect look Ali was willing to go the extra mile and spare no expense but somehow that still wasn't enough he spent an additional seventy thousand dollars on one surgery just so he could achieve his dream of looking like K-pop Mega star and his favorite BTS member Park jimin there's a message for Dr Phil so I just convinced my transition to the Korean to look just like jimin this I think is my final procedure so I'm so so happy so now that I'm done Korea I'm really trying to find jimin I'm going to all of his favorite Hangouts favorite places oh my gosh I love you that's it man I love you I love you so much starting hey BTS [Music] Ollie's story became public and he became one of the most talked about people on the internet for thinking that he could change his whole appearance and his race to look like the spitting image of someone else this of course attracted haters and people who actually empathized with Ollie man has spent 150 000 on numerous surgeries can't feel his face all to look like his K-pop Idol German he wants to look like Jim oh oh every Memorial but the big question on everyone's mind was whether Ollie's actions were fueled by a genuine passion or simply a thirst for fame and clout loves how far is this guy willing to go just for attention but look the drama doesn't end there and as time went on Ollie's statements and actions seem to contradict one another he continued to identify as Korean while also expressing his intentions to undergo more surgeries despite claiming to be a fan of BTS and Korean culture his actions and behavior often seem to prioritize attention and fame over genuine respect and appreciation prepare yourselves because this might just blow your mind most recently Ollie took to social media to announce his most notorious stunt yet Ollie had tied the knot to whom you might ask but none other than his favorite K-pop Star Park jimin not the actual person oh no but a cardboard cutout of park jimin that's right people Ollie London got married to a cardboard cutout can you believe it this raised eyebrows and left many people questioning his Kennedy and his intentions at the age of 29 Ali London took to the streets of Las Vegas to say I do in front of an Elvis Presley impersonator and tied the knot so Jimmy is our wedding congratulations on getting married to none other than me so that we can listen to something that I'm so happy my husband and with that he officially became one half of the most unconventional couple of the century Ollie said that it was such an emotional ceremony and that he felt so much love jimin was his Idol and that he had spent a lot of money on surgeries to look like him and now he has actually married him and he couldn't be happier I guess congratulations are in order for the happy couple who are we to question love here's to love in all its quirky forms right me and Jimena are going to get a divorce he hasn't even talk to me anymore carpool gym it's so 20 20. I can't date cardboard I'm a 32 year old man like seriously but of course short-lived as 2021 that he was divorcing the cardboard cutout and marrying a real person instead his new partner Danny Richardson is a 19 year old who shares his love for BTS and jimin Ollie's marriage and divorce to a cardboard cutout of jimin not only shocked the internet but also divided opinions some to this day still label him as crazy and delusional soon after the cardboard cutout wedding Extravaganza headlines started swirling about the demise of our Infamous media personality could it be so with Ollie London really dead Ollie had gone silent online and fans were quick to point out that his Instagram had been memorialized seemingly to indicate that he was dead but a section of his K-pop followers had their doubts the K-pop fans strongly believed that he was pulling off a suicide prank Ali had a history of being canceled by K-pop fans and the last time he faced their wrath was earlier in 2021 when he opened up about feeling sad and disappointed over trolls canceling him on Tick Tock the trolls they won I was reported guys my Tick Tock was apparently deleted it was gone for like one hour I think my team my manager my age and my publicists they managed to sort it you will never cancel me trolls thank you he faced a lot of abuse from K-pop fans on his live videos and there was a lot of mean comments aimed at him and people were Mass reporting his account after he had candidly spoken about developing a crush on NCT member taeyong leading to people canceling him oh my God I'm actually actually obsessed with potatoes I might change my face to look like him in the future because I love Trader whistling potato do you think Tayo can hear me in a career maybe he can hear me in Korea the drama was intense but do not worry loves because Ollie appeared from the shadows and came out claiming that his accounts had been hacked but fans were skeptical they were finding it hard to believe that he wasn't doing all of this for attention but Ollie stated repeatedly that he was not it's hard to say whether he truly was a victim or just seeking attention but one thing's for sure Ollie London knows how to keep us glued to our screens on June 18th 2021 in true Ali fashion he dropped a shocking announcement Ollie London took to Twitter to post an image of a rainbow reimagining of the South Korean flag saying that he was now identifying as Korean the last nine years I felt like I've been trapped since I lived in Korea I feel like I identify as Korean everything about the culture is me I feel like I have the look now so this announcement that Alia unified as Korean through major backlash online and many critics argued that the rainbow reimagining that Ollie posted saying that it was offensive to Korean culture and it insulted the flag's meaning transracial does not exist you are not a Korean man no matter how much surgery you do no matter how much of the aesthetic you adopt Ollie came out with his Swift response saying yes he identifies as Korean and guys I now identify fully as Korean I'm so happy I can live my life the way I want to live it finally after being trapped for so long London's manager came out to say that London felt strongly attached to Korea and the Korean culture and feels much more connected to this than his own culture they're happy to have transitioned from British to Korean I hope you like my new eyes I would love to give you a wink right now but I couldn't really not even open my eye I'm now gonna be identical to jimin even more identical than I already was and just you thought you've seen it all Ollie London took us for yet another spin in a classic way only Ollie can pull off this time around he announced that he was identifying as a transgender woman Ali proceeded to say that finally it feels like she has become the person she was born to be after struggling with an identity crisis for eight years Ali revealed that she had undergone surgeries to her face to transform her face to a Korean woman but here's the kicker loves after just six months in a shocking twist even for Ollie Ollie announced that she was transitioning back to a man so why did you decide to become a Korean woman who told you that was possible so obviously I've had a difficult time with my gender identity struggles I was never unhappy with how I looked so I started changing I started dressing as a Korean woman and I realized that was a big mistake and I just wanted to be a boy these twists and turns in Ollie's life seem never ending leaving us all wondering is this a genuine search for self or just an ongoing saga of attention seek we're gonna go to Thailand and I'm gonna undergo a production surgery so I can have the average Korean size did I make you blush do you like it when I call you only time will tell my friends but mark my words we haven't heard the last of Ollie London you never know what surprising news might be just around the corner for this controversial online personality 
06/16/2023,How Salish's Childhood Is Being Taken Away By Her Own Father,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLf1TNONEvA,147-13,hey guys I'm back again with another video on Salish matters since I absolutely am not done talking about this mess because it's extremely concerning that Jordan matter keeps making his daughter do things a 13 year old should absolutely not be doing good luck oh I'm back so I can see your faces it's time to doll and tell him that you love him what and he's been doing it for years first let me catch you guys up so Jordan matter used to be a photographer that built a YouTube channel based on showing the behind the scenes of his photography which could get pretty crazy at times oh my gosh what are you kidding me oh my gosh is also super well known for his 10 minute challenges where he would photograph people in as many weird situations as possible during those 10 minutes go go it's good [Music] she mainly got famous by getting involved with dance photography and Dance Moms in particular do you remember Lily K and Eliana from season seven they got pretty famous for their drama and actually seemed to be his favorites as he has countless videos where he's photographing them which got him a lot of attention at the time but guys this was of course all before his daughter was big enough to put her everywhere so it looks like he had to focus on other children instead it's pretty clear to me that he realized how these popular kids were giving him the most distraction because their children and because their children and had already been used to being in front of a camera from Dance Moms he could practically get them to be in any of his videos since their moms were already on board with them being filmed but then when his son got old enough to be on camera he started showing him more and more but it wasn't his usual photography content and it was actually more Family Channel oriented which is pretty very weird since he was putting him in situations a normal parent probably wouldn't like when he started posting videos titled my son's first kiss and Instagram controls my son's first date his son Hudson wasn't into dance or anything so he was really only on there for the awkward situations that would give him views which is really weird in my opinion and it of course doesn't end with Hudson as Salish eventually started getting featured on his channel more and more at first his videos with her were pretty innocent and there was nothing too concerning about them like this one where she got to adopt a puppy which was pretty cute not gonna lie but as she grew older it's pretty clear to me that he figured out what would attract attention and started featuring her in his usual content like y'all the first video he posted of her in his usual style was called kid versus adult extreme Acro gymnastics competition So Not only was he having his 10 year old daughter do these gymnastics around this grown man but he was also letting her do it in swimsuits and don't even get me started on the fact that this video got more than 50 million views while his other videos at the time got around 20 million or less after that video he slowly started to post more and more about her until eventually she practically became the owner of his YouTube channel but at the same time she started appearing more so did A Boy Called nidal which is where the whole thing starts getting even weirder Jordan made this huge deal about Salish and nidal where he kept putting them into videos together and saying not to ship them over and over again y'all when I tell you he was insistent I mean it they're way too young to ship do not ship them I don't want to see this hashtag anywhere the hashtag it's so weird especially since they're literally 11. he single-handedly made that up and we all know it anyways guys after the First videos of them together they started becoming stars of his channel and he would always put them into weird situations where they had to act like they had crushes on each other and basically pushed this will they won't they narrative however he still continued to act like he was totally against it and none of it was his idea and kept saying that they are not a couple when it is pretty obvious they aren't last video we did together there was a lot of shipping them with a nailish hashtag including voting them as one of the 10 most popular couples that is not okay with me not my little girl no more shipping them despite this he kept making videos like this guys and even started making it look like they might actually be a couple by making them recreate couples photos and couples challenges and the more he started posting about Salish the more invasive some of these videos started getting also let me just point out how Salish has practically grown up with YouTube since her dad has been doing this for a long time so it's kind of all she knows so she probably has no idea how harmful it is to put her entire life out there for everyone to see the most concerning thing for me is the fact that her grown adult father thinks it's totally okay to expose her to all of this but then again he's been working with children I'm putting them in his content practically his entire career so maybe he's not the best man to ask but y'all isn't that so concerning why exactly does he have all this power to bring Salish and these other kids onto his channel and make them do all these weird things knowing full well that this is affecting their entire childhood to him everything is about content even such a thing like his kids first sleepovers is something he is putting online today my daughter Salish and her friend tsunami compete to see who will be the last to fall asleep during their first sleepover throughout the night they attempt insane Instagram dares including two shocking phone calls like why do these kids need a camera shoved into their faces and told to entertain the viewers when they should be having fun and probably gossiping about what's going on in their lives this one sleepover Salish had with her friend tucks me was not only filmed for Millions to see but of course Jordan had to involve naylish into it as well since he won't let anyone forget about them even if he's not actually there do you like her back maybe I don't know about you guys but to me it doesn't seem like these kids have any sort of crush on each other but they're still forced to act like it for the views this isn't even something that only happens on Jordan's Channel as his entire circle seems to be doing the same thing even on nidal's OWN channel they still continue the whole nail-ish thing with videos like reacting to nailish edits and getting dating advice to ask my crush out so it's really not just Salish that's getting this weird treatment and over on nydel's channel we don't even really see any parent involved but it's so clear that they're working behind the scenes to set everything up and Jordan is most likely involved in it as well anyways guys it's starting to look like Jordan is ripping his daughter's childhood away from her and is using everything happening in her life as a YouTube clickbait title which is also shoving nidal into her life and creating this whole Narrative of nailish being a couple his fans definitely love the two together since it looks like his fan base is mostly young kids but that doesn't mean it's all right to keep doing this to them it's very clear a lot of this is extremely scripted as well in order to create drama and salish's life like every single time the two are suddenly asked to confront each other about their crushes FaceTime Nadal and tell him that you love him what no like not as a friend to be honest we all know he likes her [Music] you can't tell him it's a prank and you have to tell him that it's not as a friend but as a real I love you no okay do it let's go let's go I'm not sure I'm okay with this prank everybody out there you know this is not real right what do you think Nadal's gonna say I'm pretty sure this is real oh at this point salish's entire life basically revolves around nidal and her YouTube career which really shouldn't be the case for a 13 year old and it's extremely weird that he keeps getting away with it Jordan is over 50 years old and he hangs around kids all day long and not only dictates what they have to do but also uses them for Content since everybody knows nobody wants to see what he's up to anymore his channel might as well be called Salish matter since it's her doing all the content anyways and Jordan is just profiting off of everyone waiting to see his newly teenage daughter do fan service look at each other closer that's too close too close Okay Okay closer okay hold on okay that's good okay don't get any closer don't listen Gigi stay right there don't go closer I don't even know why he's bothering to act like none of it was his idea in the first place it's also super obvious that Salish and even nidal are very uncomfortable with some of the stuff they're being put through like guys look at this video we didn't actually kiss each other well well he fell but we didn't actually kiss the first time they tried it the doll we got closer and then tripped and something happened didn't happen you guys decide what you think why is he putting puddings about it it's clear they the original video Sailors turn your face far away give him the outside of your cheek quick peck on her cheek get out of here okay okay turn towards me say let's turn towards me get closer noodle go like this like you're gonna do it [Music] go yeah yep right there turn your face shows me a little safe oh my God what was that right no no no no no no no I can't do it I can't do it I will give you the surprise if you don't do it this couldn't have been a more obvious setup and even in that video it looks like neither of them really wanted to be doing that pose again these are barely teenagers and at that age nobody wants to get that close to the opposite gender there's absolutely no way they were comfortable doing this Salish isn't even the only person he's made uncomfortable by doing these things as he's always been known to put kids in uncomfortable situations like for example the entire video he did with Charlie demilio where he kept daring her to do things that clearly made her uncomfortable I want you to go put on pair of glasses come right to this window Tick Tock in front of them okay okay I think she's good you want to go outside sure okay you want to win the middle traffic yeah even in his more recent video Salish and nidal have to do all sorts of things to feed these nail-ish shippers like buying matching necklaces Nate English No it should be like Singlish any doll an Essence yeah we get this silver heart necklace can we have one half an S and one half an N thank you yeah perfect recreating the pasta video before your daddy gets back let's put one of these in our mouth okay and then like remember the thing that we did like a long time ago with the pasta yeah let's do that to Prince Jordan okay all right let's practice yeah good luck ew uh rude I wasn't eating you it was the sweetness of it all right I got the shirt whoa whoa no no what was that okay so-called prank kiss so I can see your faces more guys am I the only one that thinks that's too much I know I keep saying it but Jordan really crosses the line with what he makes these kids do and I'm convinced Salish is going to grow up and be extremely embarrassed by all of these videos especially since she never got to live a normal childhood without having a camera shoved into her face and being told what to do so she can please her fans I think it's pretty clear that Jordan has a serious problem and should honestly be banned from making these kinds of videos with kids in them and that honestly goes for every young person in his videos and not just Salish anyways guys what do you think of what Jordan is doing to Salish let me know in the comments down below and don't forget to check out this other video for more drama 
03/00/2023,Here’s why fans are calling Emma Chamberlain a SCAMMER!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbY9Qo4QKyQ,130-18,Emma Chamberlain really expected people to praise her for scamming her fans again but this time you guys she's actually selling an Instagram DM for ten thousand dollars I'm sorry are you Beyonce I mean even Beyonce would be ashamed to sell a DM for this amount of money it explains why people are not happy with how Emma is still taking advantage of her supporters till this day we all know that she has a history of scamming her fans since day one we're gonna get into all the details in just a second but for now make sure to stay tuned to find out what really went down if you guys know Emma then you probably know how this girl had a revolution throughout her career because she went from posting DIY videos on her channel to straight up modeling for popular magazines and attending the Met Gala to be honest I wouldn't say that she didn't grow up in a very safe and stable environment because from what we've seen on social media her mother and father supported her career ever since she started posting on YouTube and if of course once she gained followers she began experimenting with her content and that's when she really hit the jackpot not only did Emma make her entire personality known as a coffee addict but she even expressed her fashion preferences to her fans and for some reason people really fell in love with it now I'm not sure if this was a huge mistake or not but based on the controversy that followed this situation I would say that it was a big problem the reason why I'm saying this you guys is because many of Emma's fans back in 2018 were obsessed with her as a person I mean the majority of them were trying to copy her aesthetic as an iMovie vlogger and a visco girl and by that they were straight up dressing as Emma in public and copying her entire personality as this funny quirky person this situation you guys made Emma gain tons of supporters at an early age of her career in fact she became known in the YouTube industry immediately as she began collabing with many huge YouTubers such as Tana Mojo James Charles and the Dolan twins despite how she was treated as this Rising YouTuber that could potentially become a huge influencer unfortunately Emma kind of took advantage of this situation to earn money as a side hustle and well this you guys threatened her entire career before it even started from the day people began copying Emma's fashion aesthetic on social media some fans began asking Emma to release her own merch that complements her fashion sense and of course Emma did not hesitate to take advantage of the situation by collabing with the company High key who helped her release tank tops scrunchies denim jackets and even her teddy bear coats although many of her fans were highly disappointed once her merch came out after they realized that the merch pictures on her website were blurred and that they were only sold in one size yeah guys I don't know what Emma was thinking once she made this decision but not only was her merch blurred on the website but they were also expensive as well this you guys made Emma trend on social media with hundreds of fans calling her out for scamming them with cheap merch and and as a result Emma went on live to address the situation by claiming that her merch was hand sewn hence why they were very expensive another reason why it's so expensive and I know this is annoying but it's the same thing I don't know if you guys know the brand UNIF but the brand units like they hand sew like all the clothes and most of the pieces in my line were literally like hand sewn which is cool because it makes it like really nice but it also makes it kind of overpriced like the scrunchies obviously they're scrunchies it's very clear um they were literally hand sewn scrunchies and like there's a little tag in it that like they hand something they're really cute and they're really cute they're really well done and like but literally if you can imagine right like someone in a literal like place was sewing every single scrunchie so obviously we want to pay them as much as possible because they did all that manual labor not you know like whatever like that's a lot of work and of course people sold out her entire website in under two hours it's crazy that this controversy went down back in 2018 and people are still talking about it too this day because a lot of people on social media believe that Emma has a tendency of scamming her fans and this came after she launched her first ever Coffee Company shortly after she scammed her fans with merge I mean if we think about it it totally makes sense why Emma would launch a coffee company out of nowhere because as I mentioned before Emma's entire personality was based on her being obsessed with iced coffee and her being vegan however the launch of her Coffee Company AKA Chamberlain coffee left millions of fans speechless after they noticed that Emma was selling coffee bags for 60 dollars on her website as much as Emma was excited to sell coffee beans for her fans so they could relate to her unfortunately she received major backlash on social media for scamming her fans again and profiting off of her personality now you might think in this case that Emma's Coffee Company would lower their prices or even shut down their business following all the hate however strangely enough the business was able to succeed internationally you guys after Emma alleged made 27 million dollars off of Chamberlain coffee alone you know it's kind of crazy how this girl managed to profit off her business on the verge of being canceled if we're being real I feel like her strong fan base is the reason why Emma is still succeeding to this day because to me it seems like the general public is the only one upset over Emma's business tactics while her fan base on the other hand is supporting Emma constantly I mean if we really think about it I'm pretty sure Emma would have been canceled and forgotten a long time ago if it weren't for her strong and dedicated fan base because we have seen how many of her YouTube Friends such as James Charles and Jeffree Star got immediately neglected after they got canceled we can only say that Emma is just lucky enough to have people who are willing to support her every day although her recent controversy that went down earlier this week left millions of fans speechless after they noticed that Emma was selling a personal Instagram DM for ten thousand dollars on her website yeah guys I don't know what level of scam this actually is at this point but from what people saw on her website shop Emma chamberlain.com she was actually charging 10K for a personal thank you note from her and well this situation you guys made millions of fans disappointed and upset as not only were they shocked at how Emma was charging for an Instagram DM but they were also surprised at how Emma hasn't learned anything about scamming her fans 10K all she did was get people obsessed with coffee and lip balm Fair she is now in the fashion world but still this is insane the way it's more expensive than Beyonce or Taylor tickets is so crazy the fact that she doesn't even have any sort of Talent OR skill either like she's nice and all but girl she's not making enough from laying in bed and talking to herself about how terrible her life is LOL as a result of all the backlash Emma and her team decided to respond to the controversy by closing their entire website and writing a message regarding the situation and while this message claims that the Instagram DM offer was never in intended to be active or purchased and that Emma herself had no knowledge of it at all there have been false and inaccurate claims that Emma Chamberlain was offering DMS in exchange for 10K as background in 2018 Kozak Emma's merch company was testing a prospective reward program related to Emma's merch without her knowledge in testing they created an outrageous never activated reward level that was not intended to be active or purchased these reward ideas were never run by Emma since they were not meant to be available for sale or reward but simply were intended for internal testing purposes this was never made public and certainly was never planned to be sold or purchased the test program was never discoverable on the main page or product listing site which is another reason that Emma had no knowledge of this with the internet's tendency to create false

03/22/2023,Emma Chamberlain Gets Called Out ($10k dm addressed),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Bw4EjqkFoc,124-12,who would have thought that Emma Chamberlain the sister Squad member would now be hanging around amongst the Stars attending A-list celebrity events and being named the face of Brands I feel like nobody could have predicted the career that she's had and is still having as she continues to be one of the more successful influencers out there highly favored by a ton of Brands such as Lancome who just signed her as a brand ambassador in an attempt to appeal to a younger generation a girl known for her more relatable content who is anything but relatable these days but still manages to keep her fans close and keep this down to earth attitude except some were confused if that was still the case went over the weekend Emma Chamberlain found herself in some drama when someone discovers something on her merge website for her anything goes podcast now Emma doesn't really Post online very much anymore here and there she'll post a YouTube Vlog but for the most part besides sure anything goes podcast she's not really posting much anywhere so sometimes people will check on anything goes merch because she is active on the podcast and someone made a discovery that there was an option on that website to buy a DM from Emma and the cost of this was ten thousand dollars which sounds super extreme for someone who is known for being relatable plus Emma is big but ten thousand dollars for a DM from her I don't know about that I really don't so the tweet that I saw going around was sad to see Emma Chamberlain developed a God complex mindset sad to see this not even hating just genuinely disappointed and someone added a link to it and when I clicked on it it took me straight to her merch website and it was actually something that you could buy add to your cart like I was like what is going on because at first I thought it was like Photoshop something that was like a joke maybe it was an inside joke on her podcast something funny that she was doing I just did didn't think that this was something that was real and the other thing I was thinking was okay maybe this is something that she is offering but someone accidentally added a few extra zeros because it just did not seem like this is something she would be selling seriously plus when you went to her merch website it wasn't actually listed with the other merch products this was some sort of like hidden part of her website that you could only access if you specifically Googled it or if you had this link that I found on Twitter but tons of people were screenshotting it and it was going around and people were making jokes about it saying imagine paying off Emma Chamberlain DM monthly like a mortgage sorry babe we have to skip dinner tonight because I have Emma Chamberlain's DM payment tomorrow 10K for an Emma Chamberlain DM the world has truly gone crazy why is Emma Chamberlain charging 10K for an Instagram DM this is wild why is Emma Chamberlain charging 10K for a DM who is Emma Chamberlain I guess is the better question people on Tick Tock all also reacted to this wild price I mean everyone was just freaking out over it what the hell is Emma Chamberlain doing charging ten thousand dollars for a DM for ten thousand dollars Emma Chamberlain's assistant probably will send you one singular DM and then you have to live with the consequences of that decision for ten thousand dollars you can buy 57 pairs of Third Generation air pods which I would probably lose after a week or you could buy one and a half Chanel bags which is a much better investment because Chanel bags appreciate in value every year and a message from Emma Chamberlain does not carry your wallet unless you screenshot and then print out those messages and then origami them into some sort of bag anyways for those of you who are actually contemplating getting this DM I photoshopped one and it's a pretty good impression of what I believe you would get here you go I just saved you 10 grand I can't stop thinking about Emma Chamberlain having an option in her merch opt to buy a personalized DM from her on Instagram for ten thousand dollars so serious series two like you can literally look this up don't worry I mean if you still want a DM from Emma Chamberlain and you don't have ten thousand dollars to spare they have after pay it's only 902 a month for a year I feel like for the most part people on Twitter were taking this as like a joke and just confused meanwhile people commenting on her most recent photo on Instagram were being very harsh about it saying when you thought you're so important who even are you 10K for a DM that's not caring about your fans that's just caring about your pockets did the fame and money get to you sweetie there's your relatable girl the she is not like other celebrities girl there she is charging her fans ten thousand dollars for a miserable message LOL ten thousand dollars is so delusional and tone deaf shame on you charging 10K for a note I feel like a fool to have bought your coffee I'm going to donate the ones I have left you are insufferable for that 10K personal greeting like what so like I said it went all around the internet even Mr Beast join in on the conversation when somebody tweeted about it saying creators gone wild he said I'm gonna buy it and see what it says LOL but I don't think he actually could because a day later the website went under construction which made me think that this whole thing really was an error and people weren't actually supposed to see that at all and now Emma and her team are coming out to give a statement about what happened since it did kind of start a big conversation about Emma and I don't think that she wanted this narrative to continue about her that she has like this ego now where that Fame went to her head so in an exclusive statement to e-news she said a few days I started seeing comments asking why I was selling a DM for 10K I assume this was an online scam as I had never offered to sell a DM for any amount of money let alone 10K Emma says in her statement people were saying this was for sale on my merch site so I checked the site to see if it had been hacked and couldn't find anything out of the ordinary he says after doing her own digging Emma says that she reached out to the company behind her merge website to look deeper into the matter I immediately got in touch with my merch company Kozak who further investigated and put the site under construction while looking into the issue the company Kozak is the company that runs Emma merch site and they also put out a statement that went directly onto the website that explains the whole thing they said there have been false and inaccurate claims that Emma Chamberlain was offering DMS in exchange for 10K as background in 2018 Kozak Ms merch company was testing a prospective reward program related to Emma's merch without her knowledge in testing they created an outrageous never activated reward level that was not intended to be active or purchased these reward ideas were never run by Emma since they were not meant to be available for sale or reward but simply intended for internal testing purposes what we suspect is that data was activated and crawled by Google's SEO indexing system and discovered by an individual who then began spreading false information to press Outlets this was never made public and certainly was never planned to be sold or purchased the test program was never discoverable on the main page or product listing site which is another reason that Emma had no knowledge of this with the internet's tendency to create false narratives around sensationalized stories we wanted to provide you with the truth firsthand and from The Source the site is currently down for internal review Kozak Inc so that was a very big explanation as to what the heck happened here honestly a little confusing if you do not understand the creations of a website how to run a website like how to test products going up on a website that's a lot of information that they just throw at people and so some people were like you know were they actually going to launch this and they got a little backlash and they were like okay never mind let's create a little story to kind of maybe confuse people as to why we're not actually doing this but who knows what I will say is that if this is really the case that's super messed up for them to like trial something like this and not tell her about it especially with this kind of price tag they certainly should have made everything private that they were testing because clearly it's not a good look for her and I don't know how they could like run something without showing her first but it is good that they address this whole thing rather quickly and were able to sort of clear up that this wasn't something that they were moving forward with this isn't something that Emma had any knowledge of the thing that's quite unfortunate is that not everyone is going to see this response from both Emma and the website team Emma gave an exclusive statement to E news that yeah it's gonna get picked up and some people are going to see it but there's also a lot of people that aren't going to be getting that update especially if she doesn't post anything on her own Instagram since a lot of the more hateful comments like I said were on her Instagram with people just thinking that she's something that she is not because of all of this and with them saying that this was never something that was supposed to be seen by the public and that this was something that was never supposed to launch and Emma had no idea about it I mean it just makes her look really bad and that's kind of the sad part of the situation is that something happened that she didn't even know about and she's getting in trouble for her which makes me wonder if somebody had this come company is getting fired or if they're in some deep water because of this because they literally could have effed up her image at least in the eyes of a handful of people people definitely have like a bad taste in their mouth about Emma thinking that she is this egotistical little influencer now so that sucks that's for sure so that's what's going on with Emma no crazy merch to be bought at this time but some were thinking that let me know what you guys think about this whole thing that has been going around online and what do you guys think about the statement that they put out let me know your thoughts in the comments down below I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys thank you 
03/18/2023,Tana Mongaeu Is Messy (James Charles reunion),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2yG22vzf2Y,126-12,there's been a number of times where Tana Mojo has been upset with someone and had major drama with them talked a lot of crap about them but then later ended up hanging out with them again we've seen it with her friend Brooke Shane Dawson enderly every single EX that she's had including Bella Thorne she's literally ripped these people to shreds and then all of a sudden it's like nothing ever happens but the one person that Tana said multiple times that she would never make up with is James Charles who is one person you wish you never became friends with James Charles you win some elusive when I tell you I've burned enough bridges in the city I'm finally on I'm trying to be on a higher road but it's it's hard who do you still got beef with out there I guess my number one people know this obviously is James Charles oh yeah I'm gonna resolve that no he seems like a guy that's got a problem that's not going to be fixed I think yeah and I think honestly I have like I I don't really care to fit she's talked about him on most of the podcasts that she's gone on the podcast that she's also had and since the two of them used to be pretty close friends that's why the topic gets you know brought up so much because people are like what happened is there ever a chance and she's always like no never gross I don't like him I hate him all of this stuff and we were like we were friends didn't he get called out for like a million times and he's like Contin he just continues to do it and it's still just it's like such an abuse of power which I think is such a thing like if you're like you're power Dynamic to like you're young fans and like manipulate people and it's weird we were just friends for so long we like would hide so much like that from me and just do so much that in my opinion don't want to get sued um that in my opinion wasn't ethical or right and you know if I'm someone who says what you're doing is morally wrong it's going to be doing something wrong it's going to be a thing just out here like the oral police like you know of course self-righteous Tanner she's called him out for his behavior so much more than any other influencer honestly and to the point where people wondered how it was even possible that her friends could be friends with James with the way that she feels towards him Tana's friends Amari and Mario were close enough with James to film collabs with him and go on vacation for James's birthday and Brooke has been pictured with James a number of times and despite all that Hannah still kind of stood her ground that she wasn't going to make up with James and she felt how she felt about him most shocking two-faced influencer James Charles everywhere I mean the power Dynamic such a thing I think that with James Charles that really started to come into play where people during that time people began to actually hold people accountable for using their power against their fans and I think that it's crazy that it this year is the first year I thought it took way long for people to finally like start to recognize that that was happening and like and how wrong even as recent as January she was talking about James with Jeff this was when the Instagram DMS between him and someone from Tick Tock were going around and it was really embarrassing Tana couldn't wait to talk about it with Jeff like any opportunity that she can throw a dig at James she's going to take it okay look look look look what's this I'll read it I'll read it let's get right into the news sorry this one brings me like like joy and that's so me Joy James Charles is back at flirting making straight men uncomfortable the alleged screenshots reveal the benefits of being his boyfriend in one text James says it's a really lucrative role James used Instagram's vanish mode to attempt to prevent a leak this is just so funny to me okay obviously like it's wrong but I'm not sitting here like trying to actually come down on the logistics of it it's more so like if you're gonna do this like be less embarrassing obviously I will say this guy had to have been responding for it to like keep going down the thread and you know that's a benefit of the doubt I just wish the things he would say made me want to die less yeah and it's the same she's always done he's like not learning what the he's doing it's not a kid it's a straight guy like remember that a lot of his like cancellation was and is he underage no like a lot of his like cancel well I don't think so oh but he's just aggressively going after a guy that's like strike and not a boy she even quote tweeted the messages on Twitter saying new lock screen like she doesn't hide the fact that she will shade James at any opportunity that she has she in the past has even made fun of her friends when they did hang out with James jokingly having called Amari a traitor for going to James's birthday in Palm Springs uh you guys I told you guys I was at James's birthday I don't know what more you want he was at James you want traitor oh my God also poked fun adamari and Mario on that James birthday trip by stitching The Tick Tock that they posted and also commenting under their video saying so scary seriously like she was making it clear she was truly judging them for being friends with James okay you guys so if you don't know now you know I'm in Palm Springs right now for James Charles birthday I love Miss Jamie Charlie Camp Charles you know all that good stuff um but right now we just got presented with these banana bread shots banana bread shops it's like oat milk and like cookie and like banana and like I don't know it's supposed to be like really really good so we're gonna try but now it seems like something has changed and tana and James actually have made up and this is something that I did kind of maybe feel like it was going to be happening after she made up with Bella Thorne I was like I feel like Bella and her have this really crazy beef they have this crazy history she does not like Bella and then once they were friends again I was like she's probably gonna be friends with James even though she said all that stuff about James literally these are my notes from August 18th of 2022 and I literally wrote her with Bella proof she'll be friends with James again one day and look at that here we are 2023 a couple months later and appear apparently her and James are on good terms in a recent Jeff FM episode her and Jeff were talking about Lele pons wedding and James was also in attendance at this wedding in Miami and she says that they were there and decided to put the past behind them and be on good terms with each other um so we went to Lele ponsa's wedding in Miami James Charles is gonna be there and I just like kind of made up with him you know what I mean like not like we're never gonna be friends but like we have like a nice talk about just like being civil so I saw him we're like yeah slay and you're like ah you're like I just didn't I stuck to the plan you know I knew that we were gonna go there we do a pop culture podcast we talk about topics that aren't gonna sit well with some people if it's about them especially those types allegations so we gave our opinion on it and we knew that we were going there we're gonna cross paths and my whole thing is like I'm just gonna be cold and honestly I wouldn't be surprised if this already that I've been honestly but then you guys I guess said hello and it's all good now I yeah it's you know it's it's it's behind me being like an evil about it you know cool now it's my beef I guess you pass it off to me it's just crazy because she was so adamant about the fact that she would never never never be friends with James she didn't like him and she said so much about him and it's just it's just crazy I'm surprised that he would even want to talk to her at lele's wedding but with enough mutual friends I guess it was going to happen and they have stuff to talk about but yeah I mean I feel like maybe not surprising that Tana would change her mind but I'm surprised that James would be like yeah Tana's great let's you know mend things over but maybe he was tired of getting called out by her so much and this was maybe his plan to get her to stop I don't know but I will say that for a second after all of this I thought that they were hanging out like I thought that they were literally so close now that they were hanging out casually filming tick tocks together I was sisters spooked you guys but that wasn't actually the case but I'll tell you why I thought that it's because James posted a tick tock eating these candy covered grapes and said Amari was over at his house and he had made them the day before and Hannah posted this on her story the day before literally making the grapes so I was like did they hang out like did they both bring these groups over to James's but I feel like Amari probably just brought them over for James after he hung out with Tana but for a second I was like are they in the room together right now when I saw him holding that it was like Tina made those last night is Tana at his house right now do they make them together like what is going on but when I rewatched it I was like oh okay he said madamari made them last night so he wasn't hanging out with Hannah and Mari made them and he's over here filming a little YouTube video but definitely could see that happening in the future now that all this is going down and Coachella is right around the corner I'm sure they're both gonna be going and they're probably going to get a photo together oh my God I just can't picture it with all the stuff that she's said about him I feel like Tana was one of the only influencers left that was actually like still holding James accountable for his actions but I guess not I guess she is turning a new leaf and she is like I I don't know what you're talking about with James like I I never saw any of that it's just wild but I definitely want to know what you guys think about the fact that Hannah has gone in on James for years now and all of a sudden she's ready to put that in the past and the fact that James was okay with all that stuff I mean maybe not okay with all the stuff that she said but he was okay enough to forgive and forget and leave it in the past I guess I don't know let me know your thoughts in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music] thank you 
03/17/2023,The Scary Truth Of Family Vlogging,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qhtAxFMVc,125-15,family channels especially on youtube are fun entertaining and interesting to watch but at what point does it become exploitation on the part of the parent family vlogging is very popular on youtube but for those who are unfamiliar with it let's give you a definition family vlogging is when parents film their family's day-to-day lives focusing on their children in particular and upload it as a vlog that is a virtual blog while it may appear to be a cute idea there are many debates about the challenges that come with this type of vlogging ordinarily vlogging entails a person choosing to share parts of their daily life and uploading them to the internet but when it comes to family vlogging however it is up to the parents to decide what content to upload or not upload from children's inability to control their internet presence to the highly questionable conduct of charging for access to your child it reflects a challenge that family vloggers mommy bloggers and influencers have all faced in recent years is it moral to use your child for likes with few laws governing it parents are free to record and post videos of their child for all to see and to make matters worse child labor laws did not even apply to youtube until the darkest side of family youtube channels was revealed consider the case of ryan kajai a 10 year old with over 30 million subscribers on youtube and over 50 million views he has become one of youtube's highest paid stars ryan came to popularity for his online show ryan's world which features him unboxing toys on camera for his pre-teen audience in 2019 his fame brought in more than 26 million dollars for his parents he was really only eight years old at the time and had over eight youtube channels and new videos being released almost every day it's no secret that kajai works around the clock whether that be playing with toys or doing interviews his parents reap the benefits of his efforts due to his minor status however many viewers have questioned the ethics of filming your child in order to earn advertising and sponsorship dollars when family vloggers are included in the mix the situation becomes even more troubling in the last five years family vlogging has exploded on youtube parents record their young children as they play go on vacation review toys and do other activities kids from all over the world tune in in large numbers which explains why there have been a number of incidents surrounding family vloggers in recent years one such incidents would be the stauffers case the staffers are youtubers who recorded their adoption journey and in 2020 they disclosed that they put up for adoption the child after making a lot of money off of him james who runs a successful car detailing youtube channel and his wife micah from ohio had been capturing their parenting journey on their youtube channel since 2014. they only became well known after they started documenting their adoption journey the staffers began the adoption process in 2017. michael stauffer announced that she and her husband were adopting a special needs child from china whom they would name huxley so this family decided to re-home huxley after creating more than 27 monetized videos cataloging the adoption promoting a fundraiser for huxley's special needs and charging five dollars per person to unlock a puzzle piece featuring huxley's face while the stauffer's tears moved a few fans the large majority condemned them for their irresponsible behavior but what do other influencers have to say about this sophie ross a freelance writer and copywriter who frequently publicizes and criticizes influencers behavior in an effort to hold public figures accountable accused stauffer of making adoption her brand and making herself the victim sophie ross tweeted extremely depressed reading about the influencer who raised funds to adopt a son made this her brand discovered he had special needs secretly re-homed him blocked people asking about him after her followers helped fund the adoption and put out a video making herself the victim ross went on to say that stauffer only posted the explanation video after her sponsors complained that the couple gave up their child after joyfully profiting off of him for years the thread received hundreds of likes and retweets and ross wasn't the only one who took to twitter to express their outrage others have criticized stauffer's parenting pointing out what they consider to be questionable content from the last few years here's a pic of two-year-old huxley with his hands duct taped by his parents my gut and jim stopper as punishment for sucking his thumb as a coping mechanism when their older children also sucked their thumbs and were never punished one twitter user wrote posting a screenshot from one of stauffer's vlogs not everyone wishes to have children and that's fine really as people choose not to have children for a variety of reasons some of which are very much valid and should be respected however if you decide to have children it is your responsibility as a parent to raise that child whether or not that child has special needs the stauffers not only did they choose to have children they chose to adopt a child but then not just any child but one with special needs seems to me like they only wanted him for the sympathy that comes with him which thereby results in more views more clicks and as we all know more money but once they realize they can't cope with it anymore off you go poor huxley and this can be seen all over the internet with family vlogs children are being exploited every day all in the name of content remember when singer pink expressed concern about the sexualization of teen star piper raquel on the internet and pointed the fingers at the parents after piper raquel posted youtube videos and instagram photos in which she posed in a bikini how many kids like piper raquel are being exploited by their parents pink wrote on twitter and at what point do the rest of us say this isn't okay for a 13 year old to be posing in a bikini whilst her mother takes the photo for those of you who don't know piper raquel has over 8 million youtube subscribers and over 5 million instagram followers her channel is described in her bio as a place to watch crazy challenges such as boyfriend challenges crush challenges and 24 hour challenges pink has been tuning in the 8th grader couldn't believe it i don't think pink has ever seen one of my youtube videos because if she did she'd see it's just my friends and me having fun and acting like ourselves raquel told today parents the content we make is the kind of stuff anyone can watch tiffany piper's mother responded to today by saying she's just trying to help her daughter achieve her goals and that piper has always had a strong love of performing piper who noted that pink was 14 years old when she joined the band basic instinct went on to say they're only sexual if you view us that way why was it okay for her to follow her dreams but not okay for me to follow mine in an instagram post courtney stodden defended singer pink's comments by criticizing the parents of popular youtuber piper raquel it's hard for children to separate attention they receive online from predatory behavior from adults courtney wrote it's our responsibility as a society to step up and protect our kids as much as we can from falling victim to this cycle of digital grooming as adults we can see what they can't courtney may not have mentioned raquel or pink in the text of the caption but it is made clear whom the caption was referring to with the hashtags hashtag piperocal and hashtag pink while also tagging the songstress three thumbnails from 14 year old piper raquel's youtube videos were reportedly removed for violating the platform's child safety policy youtube drew thumbnails from the videos titled my boyfriend reacts to fashion nova swimsuit haul body shaming prank my boyfriend walked in on me and wearing a hot outfit then leaving him cute reaction cat ten barge senior reporter on insider's digital culture desk took to her twitter page fourteen-year-old piper raquel and her mother are defending themselves after pink called her content exploitative cat wrote piper said pink must not watch her youtube videos not so long after this piper's mother tiffany smith was sued 11 former members of piper raquel's piper squad have filed a lawsuit against the teen's mother and her boyfriend according to the lawsuit tiffany and her boyfriend are accused of physical emotional verbal and sexual abuse as well as financial exploitation tiffany smith is also accused of being sexually inappropriate with the children but more on this in the next video i hope you found this video educational and entertaining so for now i recommend that you double check that youtube content that you're watching is appropriate for both parties don't get me wrong some children's content on youtube is completely alright and children are all over so it'd be absurd to suggest that we remove all of them from youtube rather make sure that the youtubers you're watching are decent parent role models sprinkle of glitter philip defranco and lasercorn are just a few examples these youtubers also include their children in some of their videos while also ensuring the safety of their children hopefully with both viewers and content producers working on this issue these questions concerning family vlogging on youtube will be resolved in the near future if you'd like to watch more videos like this or want to know more about piper raquel's mother

03/17/2023,Jeffree Star Attacks Hailey Bieber Brand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl1kd2UfWLw,127-17,Jeffree Star is in his join the drama era and just like the Michaela mascara drama he decided to join in on this Selena Gomez versus Haley Bieber drama even though I feel like a lot of people are ready to just move on Jeffrey had to wait for his order to ship before he could even join the conversation he posted a tick tock showing Haley Bieber's skincare brand wrote and said that this package had arrived in the mail for him while he was away and he was going to review her brand well he didn't even review it he just took a giant dump on her brand without even opening a single product before he even opened the box honestly uh hi guys this came in the mail so I just got back from Paris I've been catching up here at the star Yak Ranch and life has been really busy so we are fully back to reviewing makeup and this came in the mail okay so the packaging is so boring and then I open it up and girl she literally looks like she wants to die like the focus oh my God that face is like why did I do this why did I create a skincare brand so when you're privileged and you use daddy's money and you'd never work a day in your life I guess this is what we're doing okay you guys I don't even know what to say this is so boring I'm not even trying to be funny for once this is what she's giving in this house we are team Selena and we are a team and not bullying anyone so we're gonna skip today's review wait she doesn't even deserve a pig trash can and just like Shawn Mendes said bye and it was very obvious that Jeffrey was doing this because people are currently hating on Haley right now but he literally supported her brand in order to make this video and that has me cracking up like this isn't some PR box that he's holding up no Jeffrey literally went to her website paid the money to film this video of himself literally they're rubbing her products into the trash not even attempting to review them properly he honestly probably went through the trash and recovered them after he was done filming this video but this this video just was so intense and the part that he's like claiming he doesn't like bullies had me absolutely laughing because I feel like a lot of YouTubers probably also laughed hearing him say this like Jeffree Star talking about Haley Bieber being a bully like Jeffrey starts we know Jeffrey's history here like he does not want to talk about bullying is bad I mean there were a lot of people that were afraid of him at times in their career on YouTube and even Shane who is super close with him has said that Jeffrey scares him sometimes but Jeffrey's claiming he doesn't stand for bullying no Jeffrey was pretty proud of this Tick Tock though and he even posted it on Instagram telling people to go watch it that's how proud he was okay I just did a review on Tech talk of Road skin by Miss Haley if you don't have tick tock you're missing out but then people noticed that the video was all of a sudden gone like poof Tick Tock Side Up Jeffrey you're seeing success uh we gotta remove it and flagged his video some people thought that Jeffrey deleted the video and were confused someone said Jeffrey did you delete that video he said I would never delete it says under review now what the hell another said they took the road review down and no that was the best one and he said why did Tick Tock remove it another said the Haley video got removed and I'm so sad I was in tears laughing and he said it won't even let me appeal like literally people were loving this Jeffrey this Jeffrey that was throwing Haley stuff in the trash and Jeffrey was also taking the time to say that he was going to be reviewing Selena's brand this weekend someone asked him if he was going to and he literally said this weekend so I'm pretty sure that when all the stromos going down Jeffrey said let me go on both of their websites place an order One's Gonna Be me going off on Haley and the other one's actually gonna be a review viewer it's just funny how the video got taken down by Tech talker it was flagged by Tick Tock shall they say for bullying probably and Jeffrey's talking about no bullying in his own video but he ended up jumping on Instagram stories once again to talk about the fact that Tick Tock took down his video oh a lot of you just alerted me that my review is gone I just logged on The Tick Tock and it says under review I've never had this happen to a video so I don't know what that means I mean I do but like what what's what's offensive my honesty did Haley's PR team already attack it what's happening and Jeffrey asking if his review was a little too honest cracks me up because he didn't even review the product like he barely even opened the packaging he just reacted to it and I truly don't know why Jeffrey would think that this was a good idea for him I mean I guess maybe in some sort of a way it was because people were loving it for him but obviously he's enough reviews and attention and a ton of people do that but Jeffrey has been priding himself on being someone who doesn't do biased makeup reviews and I know he did this to try and poke fun at the drama and it wasn't like a serious review but I don't know this whole thing just seemed like a yikes like he really came for Michaela when she wasn't being honest in her reviews and he was like I'm back I heard the makeup Community is calling me because there's some fraudulence going on and he was really priding himself on the fact that nobody could pay him or nobody could make him say anything nice about their brand but I feel like Jeffrey knows that if he's team Selena then of course people are going to love him and if he were to say something nice about Haley's brand people probably wouldn't like him and so he's really playing with the drama right now and that's not very unbiased makeup review isn't now Jeffrey but obviously Jeffrey did not care about how he was coming across when posting this and the only thing that he really seemed to care about is that people couldn't see it anymore since it was taken down but I guess he ended up appealing to take down and somehow Tick Tock put it back up for him and the comments you guys on the original Tick Tock were literally living for this energy from Jeffrey Lake more than I thought because originally the only comments I was seeing were people sad that it was taken down but now I was seeing the comments of the original reactions people had to this review and they said this is too iconic the way I screamed when it hit the bottom of that can this is how you stand up to Mean Girls this is the best Jeffree Star review ever no way he just threw it out iconic he did not not and someone literally said to Jeffrey you should ask Selena Gomez to let you do her makeup please like the fact that people think Selena would sit down with Jeffrey right now is wild this is everything she's against right now Selena does not want people to be attacking Haley she wants people to be mindful of others mental health so I don't think she'll be sitting down with Jeffrey anytime soon but also in general like why would she their brands don't align at all like the messaging that she's trying to send it's just not it's just not Jeffrey at all but I really can't believe how Jeffrey has managed to have this sort of comeback and is getting this level of love from Tick Tock and it only really does seem to be on Tick Tock because other people on social media weren't really living for this review quite as much as his fans on Tick Tock but he did not care he was standing by what he said in that video saying on Twitter honesty is a b sometimes get over it and now that his video is back up you can also see the caption on his video and it says trying out Road skin by the bully and mean girl at Haley Bieber the bully and mean girl it's almost like Jeffrey is talking about himself here but something I wanted to mention in this is that people were under the impression that Jeffrey was sent PR by Haley and was doing some sort of power move by throwing it away like I said earlier Jeffrey bought this like he had to have this is not Haley's PR packaging and why would Jeffree Star be receiving PR from Haley Bieber good morning everyone Hi how are you yesterday girl they tried it they tried to take my review down but um no Tick Tock is amazing they're so up and the reviews up if you've seen it you've seen it I said what I had to say what I don't like is anyone trying to flip it on me Jeffrey you're bullying the bully I just did an honest review and I never said I got PR I bought that with my own money and it's also a tax write-off so it's basically free um but I love buying makeup I buy stuff all the time I've been buying stuff to review for 10 years so I guess some Twitter account said that it was a PR kit girl I never I never claimed that stop it I just think it's so amusing how hard people ride for these people like you think Haley gives up for any of y'all she right Neil she ain't messaging y'all and she don't give a me because she's stacked to misting um but no I think that she just genuinely looks miserable the skincare is awful um and it just looked like a shoebox so I was like I guess when you have no creativity and a lot of money and you've never worked hard that's what it's giving so it's no hate it's just the truth and I think that's exactly why he made this video so much later than the whole Selena Haley drama because he had to wait for this to get shipped out to him and the timing of him also doing a Selena review like he bought this and he bought them at the same time that's why he's doing the review this same weekend that he posted this Tick Tock of the Heelys brand in other news I am free all weekend in Wyoming and I'm going to be reviewing rare Beauty finally I know the timing's a little bizarre um but I was gone for a week in Paris I tried to get a lot of reviews done and girl it didn't happen I got a few done so I have a lot of catching up to do but this whole thing is giving me the time him and Shane bought all of Kylie's skin care brand except that time he actually did use the products I still can't believe he bought this just to throw it away and didn't even try it but I want to know what you guys think about Jeffrey going so Above and Beyond in The Dramatics for this Tick Tock in order to get into the drama somehow were you living for it like The Tick Tock comments or did you think it was just ridiculous let me know in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys right 
01/18/2023,Mr. Beast Cancelled Over This,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO5tKwlvb0I,106-15,Mr Beast is making it clear that he wants to take over the chocolate bar Market with his brand feastables but the way he's recently been going about it has been pretty controversial to say the least Mr B's critics are furious with the YouTuber after a recent tweet he made where he put out a call for his followers to help clean up displays at local Walmarts and wreck his competitors such as Hershey's I think it's pretty clear that Mr Beast is really trying to take his chocolate bar brand to the next level and boy do people have a lot of things to say about it Mr Beast whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson recently took to his Twitter and he thought it'd be a good idea to have asked his fans to help clean up the feastable bar displays in their local stores some being their local Walmarts in a recent Twitter post Mr Beast astus bands to arrange feastables in Walmarts and help clean up the presentation so that it looks somewhat presentable and nice hoping that you know know people would buy them he also said that he is building a team to help arrange his products at retail stores so that it doesn't really look messy all over the shelves a lot has changed for creators and influencers over these last few years I mean we've seen many social media influencers launching their own unique Brands and many of them have even come to reach incredible Heights being stopped at places like Walmart and this idea probably would have never crossed these influencers mind however Mr Beast is calling for his fans to lend a hand and kind of just help him out with his brand and his feastable bars in retail stores we all know Mr Beast has been growing his Empire and he's come out with multiple different business ventures in early 2022 Mr Beast unveiled his chocolate bar brand called feasibles and since its launch it's even made its way to almost every single Walmart store across the US which is pretty crazy to think about I mean we have to remember like Mr Beast started out as a YouTuber and now he's made his way to Walmart stores more recently though Mr Beast has been asking his fans to help clean up the displays in their local Walmart and also move competitors out of his way while they're at it and I'm talking competitors like Hershey's this has sparked a lot of backlash as you guys can expect and we're gonna discuss what people have to say about this but the other day Mr Beast published a tweet saying I need your help next time you see beastables in Walmart and soon to be new retailers if you could clean up the presentation and make it look better that made me very happy I'm building a team to do this routinely just need help in the short term he even said in a now deleted tweet that he wouldn't complain if his fans would have moved some Hershey's Bars while they're in their cleanup process clearly showing his competitiveness and boldness with this by kind of shading a big name chocolate brand that's been in the game for years AKA Hershey's in the now deleted tweet he wrote and while you're at it if you want to maybe move some Hershey's Bars and make sure feastables has plenty of space I wouldn't complain one of his followers tweeted sharing a photo of him actually going out of his way to arrange Mr BEAST's chocolate bars for free at his nearby Walmart store I was at Walmart and saw your chocolate bar I fixed them properly anything for the team I even bought the chocolate sea salt one hashtag team Mr Beast anyways there were actually people going out of their way for what the other majority of people are quoting as buying into this unethical capitalism and not a lot of people are here for this free labor that they're doing for Mr Beast especially considering the fact that he is super rich and that he could have easily hired someone to do this for him for his company right off the bat yeah Mr Beast her candy bars are all messed up I'm a professional I'll fix them let's take a look s good again sure to the top there we go bam we need to buy one too we'll get it check out I want to mess it up now okay 21. let's see um where's the crispy quinoa crunch all right we'll get this one there we go initially Mr B started his brand feastables as a chocolate bar company but it has since expanded into cookies and even merchandise back in January he tweeted saying how he eventually wants to build these Brands and eventually be able to sell parts of them for billions of dollars so that he can give away billions in future videos he said I want to build feastables Beast Burger Etc and eventually be able to sell parts of them for billions of dollars so I can give away billions in future videos these next few years will be an interesting experiment maybe I should IPO feastables and Beast burger while they're relatively small so you guys can share in the growth feel pretty confident we can easily 100x the revenue we are doing but I don't know if that made my life too stressful or not since asking for help from his followers some have of course Taken part causing others to come for Mr Beast saying things like he's flat out taking advantage of his fans over on Twitter there's been a lot of mixed responses about this situation and here's what many people had to say Mr Beast just unlocked a new form of capitalism I hate it here it's fascinating to watch the stage of capitalism where people are honored to do free labor for rich people that don't care about them because they feel some kind of connection and loyalty like a dog wanting a tree only the tree is an imagined feeling of connection some people were even going as far as to saying that they would go out of their way to instead mess up with the shelves saying things like I'm totally going to mess with this guy's stuff if I see it on the shelves a storm of his fans have already begun helping out Mr Beast with many sharing their process of cleaning up the rocks and shelves of his chocolate bars at retail stores many are sharing pictures and videos and others are just calling them out saying that they're doing free labor for nothing organizing shelves for free in a store you don't even work in is actually insane Behavior we were just in Walmart and noticed this display needed some fixing there's others that have been taking this situation maybe a little too far saying things like at Mr Beast I will continue destroying your chocolate displays until you pay me one hundred thousand dollars now Mr Beast has been responding to a lot of these people who were actually going out of their way to clean the shelves and he was just responding with things like heart emojis and things like that but a lot of people weren't here for it because they were just saying that his fans were being taken advantage of and just doing free labor for someone who's extremely rich anyways guys this has been the whole situation going on with Mr Beast and how he recently got canceled over this on Twitter I definitely want to know what you guys think about the situation in the comments down below I love you guys so much and as always I'll see you all in the next video thank you [Music] foreign 
01/18/2023,Tana Mongeau Calls Out James Charles,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgBmwVtBQ5A,90-14,James Charles kicked the year off in drama when a Tick-Tock user posted his James Charles experience and shared DMS he received from James where he is flirting with this guy admitting he knows this guy is straight and pitching the benefits of being with him he also shared a very interesting video of James pitching reasons why they should FaceTime with each other annoying or like oh my God David you're being annoying you're like oh my God three of those are completely different like emotions that you cannot see through text you only get to actually experience those through a FaceTime caller through being in person even over the phone you still miss out on things because you're visiting somebody's facial expressions right so because you refuse to hang out with people or because you refuse to FaceTime you're not allowing people to actually get to know you as a human being and that's a massive a massive problem whenever it comes to being in a relationship with somebody I think had it been anyone else people would have felt bad that these messages were exposed but because of his past people weren't really wanting to feel bad for him especially with him admitting that this guy was straight and he knew that in a video message so obviously being that you are straight I would assume that you don't know a lot about like the gay community this has been a conversation for years now and James has always said people lie to him about their interests lied about their ages switched up on him and the issue that people have had with James is feeling like he's getting himself in these situations and then once sympathy and people seemingly have had it with him and feel like he hasn't learned from his past people have told him many times you just honestly can't be dming people on your main account you shouldn't be looking for people on Instagram social media all of this stuff because they're gonna see your follower account and they are going to probably use you so let's be careful and with the recent drama people just feel like he is not being careful even though he said he was never gonna do this all again he was not gonna get himself in these types of situations I was allowing myself to be so easily accessible to literally anybody who wanted to give me attention and have a conversation for five minutes because I was so delusional and thinking that the conversation can't hurt maybe it'll actually lead to me finding you know the one he said that he does not like being taken advantage of for who he is used for clout and you would think that he would be more cautious because he wouldn't want things like that happening again and again and again and again but here we are the messages that James sent were all revealed in this guy's Tick Tock video that he post posted and it revealed this big long pitch that James had sent to him as his way of flirting but basically saying how beneficial it is to date him including things like living my 10 million dollar house travel opportunities all of this stuff which just sounds like the opening of the door to being used if this is you know what you're trying to sell yourself as now once this started going viral the reactions came in from the public that is for sure and tana Mojo took to Twitter when this came out and she had to show you James she said new lock screen tana and James used to be friendly but in the last couple of years Tana hasn't wanted to associate with James and has been really clear that she doesn't support him in any way and there's a lot of times where Tana will talk about someone and then you'll see her at a party with them but not with James Tana has not changed her stance on James at all and we were it's like such an abuse of power which I think is such a thing like if you're like your power Dynamic to like your young fans and like manipulate people and it's weird we were just friends for so long we like would hide so much like that from me and just do so much that in my opinion don't want to get sued um that in my opinion wasn't ethical or right and you know if I'm someone who's thinking what you're doing is morally wrong it's going to be doing something wrong it's got to be a thing like just out here like the moral police self-righteous Tanner here and he even knows that she doesn't like him he's mentioned it in a tick tock before then he knows that Tana does not like him put her name on your head and you have to guess who it is Tana Mojo okay how did you know that Michael if I took your phone right now look to your only fans SpongeBob memes and [ __ ] out of my house and it's super interesting because in the recent years James has actually become super good friends with nearly every single one of Tana's friends but still Tana has avoided him and shades him continuously and doesn't seem to be ending this Feud anytime soon and so of course when all this was going down with James A lot of people were just feeling like this is super embarrassing for James so Tana was like yup this is my opportunity I'm going to laugh at him and she brought the shade she could not hold back the excitement that she had for sharing this story with Jeff on a recent Jeff FM podcast Tiana brought the screenshots of the messages between James and the sky and she was just so hyped to get into the topic okay look look look look what's this I'll read it I'll read it let's get right into the news sorry this one brings me like like joy and that's so [ __ ] it's so funny Tana took this as an opportunity to really Rel position the fact that someone she doesn't like was being called out and she found the whole thing so funny because of how James was flirting in these messages James Charles is back at flirting making straight men uncomfortable the alleged screenshots reveal the benefits of being his boyfriend in one text James says it's a really lucrative role James gives Instagram's vanish mode to attempt to prevent a leak this is just so funny to me okay obviously like it's wrong but I'm not sitting here like trying to actually come down on the logistics of it it's more so like if you're gonna do this like be less embarrassing Tana did want to take the time and say that this guy obviously had to be showing interest in James back for him to be replying so much but she just found this whole thing just so funny still and I will say that there's so many people that also said will this guy obviously had to be talking to James in a flirty way in order for James to respond and yeah I mean probably but the fact that he said he's Straight Like That should be clue number one is we need to get out of the situation James obviously I will say this guy had to have been responding for it to like keep going down the thread and you know that's a benefit of the doubt I just wish the things he would say made me want to die less like I just don't understand how James sent this guy a video acknowledging that he knows he's straight and just thought to himself that you know okay I can change him like no no no that's not the mentality that's not no that's not okay that's not right let's walk away because this isn't the first time that something like this has happened James with you and he said that he doesn't want to be an experiment he doesn't want to be used he doesn't want any of that like James has literally made a video sat down and addressed exactly what he's done wrong in the past and how he's going to prevent it going forward but yet we're still back in the same place once again I recognize that this is my own fault I wish more than anything I could go back in time and stop myself from making all those jokes about straight guys years ago and talking about dating and how I was single and how I wanted a boyfriend so badly like I wish more than anything that I kept that private and fortunately at this point there's nothing that I can do about that other than just be better moving forward so he should definitely hear those words I'm straight and keep it moving keep it moving they are playing games with you and even Jeff was saying in this episode with Tiana just how ridiculous it is that this keeps happening with James where he is getting called out and exposed to talking to people online it just happens over and over and over again yeah and it's the same she's always done he's like not learning what the [ __ ] he's doing it's not a kid it's a straight guy like remember that a lot of his like cancellation was is he underage no like a lot of his like cancel well I don't think so oh but he's just aggressively going after a guy that's like Jeff even admits that he unfollowed James because he just doesn't support him in the things that he's been called out for over the years can you read your DMs with James Charles right now yeah I unfollen him after this past week because I realized I was following him and all this stuff and your beef with him you know we got each other's back we ride together and it's bad you're doing the same you've been doing for the past three years and all Santa could do was just laugh at James for this whole thing she was just enjoying every single little bit about this and all he messaged the guy back after was go yourself David wait what the guy's name is David but like sorry TW um the guy's name is David and after the guy exposed him all James said was go [ __ ] yourself David wow damn he is salty huh I guess I don't know so clearly Tana is not any closer to wanting to clear the air between her and James even though they have all these mutual friends it just clearly isn't going to happen and I certainly want to know what you guys think about what Tana had to say about this the fact that she was literally on cloud nine hearing that James was being called out for these embarrassing messages so let me know what you guys think in the comments below I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music] 
01/13/2023,TikToker Reveals New Details About James Charles Predator Behavior..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU_6c48acmc,89-14,here we go again with James Charles getting exposed for the 20th time this decade for pressuring straight men into dating him but this time you guys the situation took a shocking turn and I believe many people are sliding with Chase before we get into the situation that went down with James and how he ended up getting canceled and saved by the internet all at once I do want to make it clear first that the majority of the information and screenshots mentioned in today's video have been proven to be true so if there's any fabricated evidence included in the video then make sure to point it out in the comments below without further Ado guys let's just jump in and touch on the details surrounding James's recent drama and how it led to him getting canceled again it's crazy how the past few years have been really bad for James I mean this man literally had his Peak twice in his career which is very rare for an influencer because he went from Gaining millions of views with the sister Squad to getting canceled by toddy Westbrook and Jeffree Star and after a year of him trying to gain back the attention he had James managed to find a way to earn more money and Views by hanging out with the hype house but all good things had to come to an end later on after James got canceled for pressuring straight men and hitting up underage boys this all started after an underage tick tocker who decided to post a video on Tick Tock about James and how he tried hitting him up on Snapchat despite knowing that he was underage at the time I was excited because he's my biggest influence I went into the bathroom and I guess he saw the bathroom light so he started making the conversation very soon it made me really uncomfortable not only did the explicit photos from him but he even revealed that James knew he was a minor and continued flirting with him and y'all this situation made James get canceled immediately off of social media without having any pure evidence that the victim was being truthful but of course we always have to believe the victim first in any situation and I'm glad that people actually did this time because tons of victims decided to come forward months later to expose James in multiple videos and in those videos not only did the victims reveal how James tried forcing them to send explicit pictures despite being straight but they also exposed him for trying once again pressure miners as well just check these out excuse me [Music] at this point people were sick and tired of James constantly using his ego to pressure Street men and miners to send him explicit pictures and that's how the cancel James Charles movement began on social media thousands of people came to the conclusion that James Charles should be wiped away from the internet immediately this started a huge hate train towards James that left him with no choice but to take accountability since he tried at first to get away with multiple accusations that almost ruined his career but this time it was more serious than before after the entire internet went against him to the point where he lost tons of brand deals and sponsorships just from those accusations of course James took a break at first to make people forget about him for a while but then he tried returning to social media afterwards with YouTube videos of him holding himself accountable and having an open conversation with his fans about his behavior surprisingly none of these videos served Justice for James at all since people were already bored of James manipulating his fans and playing the victim all over again but I feel like what made James wake up and realize that he had lost everything was when morphe AKA The Makeup Company James had a contract with decided to drop James out of their contract this news made James take a long break on social media after he realized how his career could officially be done but for some reason people felt that James needed to hold more accountability for his past actions as well after they resurfaced tons of old videos of James justifying Ophelia and showing his interest towards minors more than people his age so the thing is for me I'm 21 but like I said I have the mentality of a 40 year old yeah so for me like I'm much more mentally and emotionally mature than a lot of people my age I'm not physically attracted to older guys which sucks like I would date like the absolute youngest like 18 19. another situation happened months later with James after a straight influencer decided to expose James for asking to send his Snapchat username and while despite how the influencer refused to reply to James James was able to use his Snapchat username trade nudes with him and blackmail him on Instagram that he would leak his nudes and in which the influencer went on Tick Tock to clarify that James got the wrong Snapchat username I thought it was funny that he asked for my Snapchat so I said I'll make a little funny video out of it you know I wasn't that deep so then I guess he unblocks me and he sends me those text messages basically trying to Blackmail me you know first off homie I had tattoos on both of my hands if that was me in those pictures you would be able to see my tattoos and second mine don't look like that you feel me that's not mine dog three if I had added you on Snapchat that would have meant that at some point I would have accepted your DM and gave you my Snapchat so why is your DM still in my request Why didn't it go straight through that's cause I never answered you yeah it's crazy how not only James got trolled by another person instead of the actual influencer he wanted to trade picks with but he even exposed himself for trying to Blackmail the influencer and leak his fake nudes you you cannot deny the fact that James was right in the head while all this was going down and I truly believe that he needed to face real consequences for his actions but the next story I'm going to tell you will probably make you have mixed opinions over these accusations towards James and here's why earlier this week James Charles started trending on social media again with thousands of tweets being made about he was being a creep online again and how he tried to hit up other straight men so I've tried to investigate the situation to find out what really happened and y'all here's the full story basically a tick talker called David decided to go on Tick Tock this week to show proof that James followed him and asked for his age in the DMS and just to keep in mind David followed James back on Tick Tock after he followed him so keep that information in mind anyways shortly after they both followed each other on Tick Tock they began texting on Instagram by using vanish mode and of course David decided to leak screenshots of James talking about the benefits of being his boyfriend it's a really lucrative role it's called my boyfriend requirements 6-2 plus must love escape rooms horror movies and cuddling big armpit here and an occasional FaceTime call the salary is zero dollars but it's a good job offer I think perks include a cute boyfriend with a great personality and huge acts free living in a 10 million dollar house in La fun travel opportunities good head and more I'm still not sure whether James was being sarcastic in those texts or not but based on what I've seen I think James was being 100 serious in those messages now here's where things got worse because despite how David was trying so hard to expose James for being weird in his DMS he still wasn't providing any type of shocking information that could lead James to getting canceled until David decided to pull the receipts and post a video confirming that James knew about him being straight beforehand so obviously being that you are straight I would assume that you don't know a lot about like yeah this honestly looks very bad for James considering the fact that he has stated before now that he will not hit up straight men again after his cancellation happened in 2021 but here he is again trying to hit up another straight man anyways David continued posting more proof of James pressuring him to do a FaceTime call and y'all just take a look at how weird and uncomfortable it gets so if I'd be like oh my God David you're annoying over text right you don't know if I'm saying like oh my God David you're being annoying or like oh my God David you're being annoying you're like oh my God David you're gonna be [ __ ] annoying all three of those are completely different like emotions after this David posted more text between him and James where James was seen getting jealous over a girl that David followed on Instagram and to make this even worse James even mentioned his body count to David and that he just lost his competition with her this is all just crazy information to receive about James especially since he's been known for being egocentric and self-confident but based on these texts it proved that James is nothing but a lonely person who desperately needs a person in his life anyways after all these videos that David posted went viral and gained tons of attentions on social media David proceeded to post a nude screenshot of James telling him to go f himself following the backlash he received over the situation and in my opinion I feel like something isn't adding up in this entire situation to me it just seems that these straight men enjoy leading James on and engaging in the conversations just to expose him you cannot deny the fact that these straight men weren't entertaining James in those DMS for James to write such a thing and be so comfortable with them in those texts I mean David and so many other straight men who have come out to expose James have rarely shown their own messages they've sent to James in those conversations and this just proves that these straight men are only entertaining conversations with James Charles just to post it for cloud I cannot believe y'all made me defend James Charles at one point in his career but someone had to say it because neither James nor the rest of the media is doing its job correctly just read some of the comments that people loved about this entire conversation I have a hard time believing that these men James Charles be dming don't like the attention like you can easily block that man James only fought in this specific situation is being corny and chasing after straight men however this guy is obviously leading James on to blast him online like this is homophobia plain and simple and this is why I don't often talk to people from online because few weirdos are out for clout that you want to set someone up to expose them this is a violation not a leak it should be illegal and I can't wait for the law to catch up to our current technology anyways loves make sure to click on the tab above for more juicy videos on these influencers 
01/07/2023,The Dark Side Of The Norris Nuts..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7rgCs1jjWo,86-16,being an influencer is becoming more of a popular career path as millions of people join social media each day but as the industry had become very saturated some people go to extreme lengths to pull in views so that they can make their day-to-day lives their full-time income but when you bring your children into your career by creating a social media presence that revolves around your family there is a point where some of these influencers go far past the point of sharing their children online to actually exploiting them and in today's video we're going to be diving into one of the families that have caused huge outrage and been hit with some serious allegations from animal neglect to child exploitation so let's take a look at the Dark Truth behind Norris nuts the Norris nuts are a family YouTube channel that have become one of the most successful in their genre they have well over 6 million subscribers and pull in millions of views on pretty much all of their videos that they make the channel revolves around the six children in the family Sabre who's the oldest child then Rocky biggie Naz disco and charm who's the youngest child at just three years old Justin Norris who is well known for competing at the Olympics in 2000 for swimming and his wife Brooke besides Justin having somewhat of a celebrity status at one point for being an athlete it is actually the eldest sibling Sabre who's the reason behind the family's rising to popularity she was even invited onto the Ellen show for her talents in sports this prompted Justin and Brooke to create a channel where they could let their viewers into their daily life the Channel's content is mainly split into two topics one being Vlogs which show the things that the family get up to and also challenges where the North's nuts are set to do various different tasks like seeing who can eat more cupcakes or compete in challenges like whoever stays in the bathroom the longest wins a thousand dollars obviously nothing seems to be inherently shocking about the channel it seems like nothing more than parents having fun with their children in front of an online audience however when you look further into their videos you can see that not everything is as innocent and as playful as it may appear over the course of their career on YouTube Justin and Brooke have come under Fire for various different reasons however one of the main things that they receive criticism for is how invasive they can be at times towards their children if you were to binge through all of the Channel's content you will notice that on multiple occasions the children are filmed crying and this is usually put into the thumbnail of the videos to grab attention this has obviously raised concerns from viewers as not only do they find this to be super disingenuous but also tons of people have pointed out how weird it is that in a moment when your child is clearly in distress what reason you would have to shove a camera in their face and post their meltdowns online for anything apart from attention and money in this video posted to their Channel Sabri lost a skateboarding competition and becomes extremely upset due to putting so much pressure on herself and the entire time her mother Brooke keeps the camera in her face capturing every tear and then proceeds to post it online for Millions see a small child in a vulnerable state the Legends don't care they have someone is like oh so he was going to do well so he was going to really do well all the Legends are there guys and they were all like they all knew it they all knew our song and they all knew about you Legends and I felt like because I knew they let everyone I'll let you down by not winning even though it is completely normal to cry I can't imagine being the age I am now and knowing that millions of people I have literally never met have seen me basically break down on camera in a Reddit thread discussing the Norris nuts one user wrote used to watch them and uh the video where they humiliate Biggie and shove the camera all up in his face while he sobs is just nope nope nope and another pointed out how strange and unconventional the kids lives were saying I feel bad for these kids they are not growing up normal and it's evident through their personalities this brings me on to the next point of concern for a whole lot of people who have seen the family's videos which is the norse's parenting and how they raise their children now now I know that everyone raises their children differently and you shouldn't assume that the way you raise your own children is better than anyone else's however in this case some of the things that have been seen in the Norris nuts videos have been interesting to say the least besides all six children basically having no privacy as they are being filmed and made to create content nearly 24 7. they also seem pretty isolated from the world outside of their tiny domestic bubble the Norris nuts are homeschooled which Justin and Brooke have always weirdly dodged or comically brushed off any questions when this topic is brought up however none of the kids in the family seem to have any friends besides each other they obviously don't get a social life at school because they aren't educated at home but despite vlogging their life pretty extensively none of the Norris nuts seem to have any form of social life that doesn't include their parents or other siblings instead of making friends in the real world they're kept in a routine of making content and kept stimulated by competing for cash prizes and challenges staged by their parents and on top of this none of the children are allowed a mobile phone or social media besides Sabri who has only recently been allowed to have her own phone at the age of 17. all of this just seems like it would be really detrimental to the development of their social skills when they become adults but this isn't all they have also been called out with allegations of sexualizing their children particularly Sabre for Content this is because of videos such as this one which is titled parents react to my scandalous Halloween outfits in which Sabri basically dresses up in a mature costume to get her parents opinion of course there's nothing wrong with showing off your body and no one's body should carry any sort of stigma however she isn't even 18 yet and a lot of people have questioned if it's a wise decision to make a video that could bait creeps into clicking for the wrong reasons purely for money this video literally got over a million views and I feel like considering the fact that the Norris nuts is known to be a channel focused around children it's pretty naive of Justin and Brooke to not think about who might be using videos like this for disturbing reasons because the Norris nuts are basically the reason the channel has so many subscribers and the reason that the channel makes so much money it has brought up a debate on whether the parents may actually be exploiting their children there is at least one video per week uploaded to their YouTube and these aren't just simple q a type videos that can be filmed quickly in an hour the content consists of Vlogs that require the children to be in front of the camera constantly for entertainment and also challenges that sometimes go on for a whole 24 hours and it looks like obviously the hard work of the Norris nuts has paid off as they easily make a million views per video which has led them to taking home an estimated 28 million dollars per year however neither Brooke or Justin have ever really shared whether the money is actually going or if the children are even paid at all we can see some of the areas that it goes to for example their huge house and lots of expensive vacations but for all we know as soon as the kids grow up and move out there is no evidence to suggest that any of them will be set up for Life by the money that they themselves earned by working their entire Our Lives even though to so many the questions about how ethical the Norris Channel and parenting is seems pretty apparent and clear Justin and Brooke have mostly escaped any major backlash this is probably a result of their target audience being children and young teenagers who don't really understand how a lot of what the norrises are doing is wrong but this clean streak didn't last forever as there was one occasion in particular where the norrises landed themselves in a lot of trouble so by this point we can see that Justin and Brooke have used their children to make millions of dollars but it turns out that it didn't just stop with their kids as they actually have a pretty disturbing history with exploiting animals that they purchase to be new pets and the way that one of these pets was treated caused a lot of people to see Justin and Brooke for who they really were the norrises bought their dog called Bubba from a puppy Farm despite Justin being known for not being the biggest fan of dogs and Biggie being scared of them the first red flag of this situation was that they bought Bubba from a puppy Farm which are extremely unethical Brooke attempted to justify spending thousands of dollars on the new family pet because according to her rescue dogs have problems with their skin however puppy Farms like the one that Bubba was purchased are at are literally illegal in the state of Victoria in Australia then not long after Bubba was introduced the YouTubers announced that their new puppy had sadly passed away due to some sort of accident involving Justin but they were extremely vague in their video update and didn't really give any details on what happened allegedly the parents role on their Instagram that Justin had accidentally stepped on the dog which caused its death however this was then swiftly deleted and no one was 100 sure of what happened however what made this situation a whole new level of problematic was that Bubba passed away just six days after Justin and Brooke brought it home however they kept this illusion going on that Bubba was still alive so that they could make money off the small amount of content that they got before announcing her death and to top things off the kids are known to edit the videos so essentially after basically being trauma ties by seeing their brand new puppy die they had to edit content made with the puppy knowing that Bubba was dead Brooke and Justin then pretty much immediately replaced Bubba with a brand new dog who was yet again bought from a puppy Farm who they called winky thankfully winky didn't meet the same fate as Bubba but the damage had already been done and tons of people were completely outraged with how irresponsible Justin and Brooke were one user on Reddit wrote they didn't do their research when deciding to take these pets and it's obvious they want the pets because they're cute and fluffy the Norse nuts channel has definitely brought up a long debate on social media which is where the line crosses between sharing your children online to exploiting them for money of course no one really knows the full truth on whether there is something dark going on behind the scenes or if Justin and Brooke are actually like any other parents but perhaps a little naive what do you guys think thanks for watching and I'll see you all next time
