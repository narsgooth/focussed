11/08/2023,Harper CALLS OUT Piper Rockelle To FIGHT.. (Piper Responds),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wzzU1XIZFU,208-14, Piper let's fight even after announcing that she was leaving YouTube you guys have decided to always be on Piper's business Piper could be meditating in the middle of the forest but someone somewhere will still somehow sneak her name into their business and that's literally what has been happening so because you guys have insisted let's talk about this okay who do we have here it's Harper well Harper is a just a sec let me Google Harper Harper uh nothing I see oh guys Harper is just some girl okay she's a Tik tocker with over 3 million followers so she has done fairly well for herself Harper hosts a podcast with her other friends and it's actually a very interesting one so maybe she decided to mention Piper's name in one of the episodes just for clout so there's a clip that has been doing the rounds on the internet where Harper is being asked which celebrity she'd do a boxing match with and she immediately goes hyper Harper if you got the opportunity would you do a celebrity boxing match yes with who Piper rockel Harper and pyer rockel boxing would be wild hyper let's fight she's coming oh that was really scary funny enough people caught on to this story and some are already taking sides I feel like Piper would win though stop cuz Piper can't fight Harper would win guys people are literally tagging Piper and encouraging them to fight unprovoked just to see who could properly whoop the other who do you guys think punch is the hardest between y'all three Harper for sure we're going to blindfold cash and everyone's going to punch him I'm not letting him punch me in the face I'm going to distort your face round one fight oh good that that's a good little hit I would definitely watch this I want to see this me patiently waiting for this fight also team Harper and what makes this even funnier the story managed to spread so much that Piper got wind of it it definitely did because she later made this video Piper responded in her video with her friend Anna Kate the caption clearly says when someone calls you out for a fight on social media wait till we see you at anak o looks like it's going down y'all Harper would win 100% but no hate Piper I love you team Harper let's not jump Harper now oh babe no Harper will deaf hurt you Harper is just better accept it why are people saying Harper would win seriously though how come everyone strongly believes Harper will win she's literally way younger than Piper anyways and what do I know about wrestling the last time I got involved in one I was six but my sibling yanked me and you'd think I had burnt all her clothes when in real sense we were just fighting over the TV remote okay but I personally think Piper would win not Harper oh finally someone with the same thought as me oh my goodness why does this now feel so interesting to watch also this Harper girl is quite the character when I was 4 years old I got I was wiping and I got poop on my fingers and I thought it was Nutella so I cuz oh oh no am I the only one that thinks this is funny so many people already like her personality and she is likely on some good stuff but fighting Piper ain't one of them well Piper can be dramatic and Petty I mean we've all watched the squad but I just don't think she can physically fight anyone speaking of the squad or let's say the former Squad so much has been happening despite the fact that they broke up so long ago and funnily enough everyone has a beef with Piper let's just start with Aliana and her dog Saga cuz it's a whole mess to make matters worse the least-liked person in Piper's life is involved of course it's her mother well allegedly Tiffany kidnapped aliana's dog Lola and has refused to release Lola back to Eliana to make matters worse Lola has been seen looking extremely miserable and emaciated meaning Tiffany hasn't been taking care of the poor dog by now if you're a true Piper fan you already know that whatever she's smack in the middle of drawing drama either Lev or Gavin must be involved as well and so in this dog kidnapping mess Gavin found himself between a rock and a hard place when fans kept asking him to comment about the situation during a live stream at first he seemed confused with the whole comment section having a field day with comments like justice for Lola Justice for Eliana tell Piper to return eliana's dog Gavin literally behaved as if he didn't know what people were talking about and then suddenly as if he had just remembered something now he had something to say and literally shocked people even more Gavin said Lola wasn't kidnapped but instead Elana gave it to Tiffany willingly which beats logic cuz then why can't Tiffany just return it also what is it with this woman beefing with ex Squad members for goodness sake these are kids could it be that Tiffany is still mad that they not only ditched Piper but that they are suing her you know with Tiffany you can expect anything because that woman doesn't mind getting into the mud to fight with a pig by now you all know how much she mistreated ex Squad members and worst of all exposed them to adult content anyways loves the whole dog thing has now gotten into a lawsuit because Eliana is still insisting that she never gave away her dog and that Tiffany kidnapped it I will speak more to this soon Lola is my dog on all accounts and I have never given her away to anyone my parents and others have made repeated private attempts to issue her return their messages have been ignored I don't know about y'all but I think Piper and her mother are being shady here unless this is something they are not telling us about dog otherwise there is no way they'd be willing to go to court over this Tiffany seems to have way too much time that she doesn't know what to do with no wonder she's out here beefing with kids her daughter's age woman please get a hobby learn how to sew or something we are not done talking about Gavin y'all at this point he needs to make up his mind whether he wants Piper back or not because what is this so Gavin posted this video with the caption whatever letter pops up is your soulmate and then the letter P popped up of course that's Piper and before you say there are so so many names beginning with p I know and Gavin knows that as well he was definitely talking about Piper and if I'm wrong then tell me why Gavin acknowledged this comment someone asked Piper and he liked that comment instantly and on top of that here's what he wrote literally first try it's meant to be you know this is actually very cringe because Gavin is always out here doing BFF stuff with Lev and with such videos he's being sus Lev would now be confused because he can't tell whether Gavin is truly his friend or just hovering around waiting for the perfect moment to snatch his girl it becomes even more challenging because if y'all can remember Gavin and Piper breakup wasn't just one of those nasty cases where people fight and block each other it was more like the love fizzled out and they decided to just be friends oh no that's not correct it was Tiffany again neck deep in her daughter's business as usual you all remember when Gavin said that they broke up because Tiffany wanted to control his life like she literally wanted to dictate everything including the people he was allow owed to hang out with and places he would go like Tiffany made the piper Gavin thing a business deal and it became so stressful for the poor kids that Gavin had to leave Piper and Gavin also don't have neither the time nor privacy to hang out on their own so you see maybe they still lowkey like each other and the only thing hindering their being together is the fact that Piper is in a happy relationship with Le Gavin seriously needs to stop with these teasers and move on because now look he's making Piper look bad piper probably won't even end up with Gavin or Lev I feel like Piper might be cheating because all of a sudden Gavin comes back into Piper's life doesn't Lev understand already like there's so many red flags when does Gavin not talk about Piper LOL why does that not surprise me Piper getting back with Gavin would be such a dream come true to all the fans who are always shipping them together # pavin but can you'all imagine how much of a betrayal that would be to L like the number of times the two have sat across each other as best friends and addressed this issue literally not so long ago Gavin and L talked about this issue during a Q&A and someone asked Gavin if he enjoyed being friends with L and he said he actually does love him someone else asked Liv if he was comfortable with all the pranks Gavin usually pulls on Piper and he said he was cool with it Gavin even told friends to be on the lookout because he'll be pranking Gavin back very soon so yeah Lev is pretty cool with Gavin maybe all these are just pranks or those silly games they like to play because it's not like Piper is innocent either she does the same how many times has Piper click baited her breakup with L and in all those instances you'll literally see Gavin immediately being there for her sometimes I feel bad for Gavin's girlfriend anyways Piper likes the attention from these two guys even going by one of her latest Tik Tok videos well of course this is an ad but still she enjoys doing these kinds of videos which appears as though L and Gavin are fighting over her at this point literally everyone just walks dreams sleeps and eats thinking about Piper and all these Squad members always have a thing or two to say about her even so long after they have parted ways and no don't get me wrong it's not like I'm on her side well I swear to ma' but I also feel sometimes people mention her for no reason at all like the Gavin video or even that Harper Girl by the way loves do you also want to see a piper versus Harper fight and whose team are you on it's definitely not a good idea but funny enough so many people are excited to watch it go down also don't forget to click on the tab above for more videos on these celebrities and and influencers

10/25/2023,Alabama Barker & Aya's Beef Has Gone TOO FAR,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmrylBViVeY,200-11, in my life I'm such like a I'm in such a good space I have so many big things coming that like I'm not even going to give this little girl the attention that she wants like she us to shake her ass on Instagram for attention I don't y'all this Alabama Parker and ya beef is getting insane from throwing sneak disses on IG live to rumors of ya getting cozy with DD oama these X BFFs can't even stand each other right now today we'll be looking at how these two have had the biggest falling out in Friendship history is funny like I really know her if she wants to fight me tell her to buy a flight to La I bet she W so for those who don't know Alabama Barker and ya used to be Inseparable the two were on their way to becoming Tik Tock royalty everything was going well they had millions of followers on social media and Alabama even took to social media to announce her new bay DD aama the couple was a hit so much so that Alabama started referring to Deb as her husband I me de in a however their romance didn't last long rumors started spreading on social media that Dei and ya had a thing the rumors became even stronger when it came out that Dei was liking a lot of A's picks online but DD came out and quickly shut down those rumors posting a video of him and Alabama getting cozy together but then seemingly overnight she broke up with DD and unfollowed him on social media now this is where things get very interesting loves am missst all of this breakup drama she unfollows ya and doesn't say why that's when the rumors became even more and people started saying that it's because of Dee I'm so happy with myself that like this is comedy to me it's pure comedy now during this whole thing ya was silent until a clip of her and her friend CJ started going viral in the clip CJ asked a to name her ex's and de's name comes up and the internet went wild how many how many I got let's see you you talk to half the dam um a couple Austin um um yes some La a whole bunch of LA but the drama didn't end there a screenshot of someone commenting that a looked better than Alabama started going viral and CJ commented below saying duh I mean was ya using her friend to diss Alabama I'm telling you guys this drama was just the beginning now of course Alabama had to respond in a series of back and forths with CJ Alabama went at him hard with at one point Alabama posting I'm On One try me with the post seemingly aimed at CJ and CJ to Alabama saying baby you tried yourself hush and get out of my DMs then CJ proceeded to post DMS between him and Alabama this story is getting Messier by the second you guys I mean Alabama's beef isn't with CJ but it looks like she's beefing with everyone at this point so during all this drama I was staying relatively silent that is until one day she went on IG live and she started laughing after someone commented that Alabama had won the beef between them after the live IA posted on IG saying that she doesn't want beef on the Internet only in real life and then she tagged Alabama on the post this started a whole series of back and forth messages between Alabama ya and CJ at one point during the exchange CJ dared Alabama to take a fight and come face them Alabama responded by saying that she has stopped giving her time and attention to ya because she doesn't deserve it Alabama continued by saying that a fell off a long time ago and she threw even more shade at a after she was featured in Ice spice's Deli music video by saying say I would hate to be a behind the scenes girl in a music video and even wait even after she added me cuz she doesn't do the internet beef right even after she added me I texted her privately I don't feel the need to post about it like how she like oh don't get me started on her friend either however this whole Alabama and a beef has drawn a lot of mixed reactions online with most people being confused about it and others calling it silly just look at some of these reactions this is LOL why are a and her friend tripping so much though for what over a boy who probably will break up with them in like a month why does everyone have to have beef on the internet that's so embarrassing they all need to grow up like why does everyone have to have y'all's problems not these two beautiful girls beefing over a little boy trying to start drama cuz nobody watches y'all Alama you don't need to do that but this isn't the first time that Alabama Barker has been involved in drama a while back back Alabama had negotiated a deal with a hair stylist to do her hair for $2,000 with half of the money paid in cash and half in promotional work which seemed like an amazing deal to the hair stylist because Alabama had a ton of followers however Alabama didn't keep her end of the deal she didn't post tag or even mention anything about the stylist I did not tag him on Tik Tok because I did not love my hair this led to the stylist to share the story on Tik Tok a few months ago this influencer reach out to me wanted me to do her hair and I was totally down I'm like yeah sure let's do it when it came time to talk about prices but she was asking me for half off in Return of our promotional post so I accepted to do a half off for a promo that never arrived again for something that she never delivered cuz she just tagged me in a picture but she never mentioned me no stories and no mention just a tag but this person was mentioned in a magazine cover as one of the richest kids in the world in the world Alabama quickly responded to The Stylist with a video but this made things way worse here's us talking about the promo deal he never once said no to it not only did he not say no to it even after my hair was done and after we did the promo deal he never texted me complaining the only thing he's done is bring it to social media he hasn't come to me mind you this is a grown man he hasn't even said hey will you send me this much money because I feel like I didn't get enough recognition in a response video Alabama didn't even acknowledge that she made a mistake she even went a step further and claimed that she didn't like the hair stylist's work The Stylist proceeded to share screenshots of their conversations exposing Alabama's lies and disregard for his time even Alabama's mom wanted free services from the hair stylist which adds to the controversy and it's not like they can't afford it I mean Alabama's net worth alone is like $5 million people online couldn't believe the news when they heard it so they did what people do best and shared their opinions on the drama online I think she should just pay full price and he should give the less fortunate because people like Miss Barker don't deserve it they have more money than sents by the sounds of it I honestly thought Alabama was nice and an unpraised class girl that's some strong opinion right there anyways Alabama received a lot of backlash online with people bringing up her previous scandals from black fishing to using racially insensitive language in videos she started receiving hate constantly but recently she started opening up about dealing with internet trolls in a post on her IG stories she responded to a fan who asked how she managed to stay positive on social media and she responded by saying I'm not going to sit here and lie and say it's easy and to keep pushing it gets very challenging especially when they don't know you I feel very misunderstood it's all part of the lifestyle people are going to hate regardless don't entertain what people say about you if you know yourself and your morals and your intentions Nothing Else Matters Alabama advised her fans not to feed into the Hate by responding but that doesn't mean she isn't tempted earlier in September Alabama said that sometimes she found herself wanting to clap back at people when they started mocking her over her weight she however decided to open up about her autoimmune disorder while she didn't go into detail she did say that a thyroid problem and autoimmune disease contributed to all her changes in weight I also have a thyroid problem and an autoimmune disease so that's one of the main reasons why I have weight gain so it would be very appreciated if you guys just keep your opinions to yourself it will get you further in life she took to social media to say that's my face when I see all the fake Pages commenting about my weight in Paparazzi videos saying I'm a catfish she continued or that I'm fat first of all let me eat you up because I'm so fat Paparazzi will purposely take pict pictures of you with your mouth open in the middle of a sentence and an ugly picture they can get of you just for the views you guys also act like I've gained 1,000 lb it's like 5 10 lb which is so normal for a lot of girls weight fluctuates and I don't want any girls that are young watching this that are gaining weight to ever think there's something wrong with it now she said amidst the drama she's been facing over the past couple of months one person she could count on for support and advice was her stepmom Courtney Kardashian Alabama said that ever since Courtney announced her pregnancy they both have been getting closer and supporting each other on their various Journeys their closeness was evident when back in April Alabama wrote a sweet birthday tribute to Courtney on her 44th birthday happy birthday court she wrote on her Instagram story at the time you are the best stepmom I could ask for you are so caring and generous for others you are such a family person and such a hardworking mom even if you don't feel good or had a hard day you always put your family first Alabama added you have such a beautiful Aura I wouldn't want another step mom Alabama Barker has truly had a rough couple of months from breaking up with her boyfriend to beefing with her former BFF I mean I don't know how she does it if there's someone waiting to put this past year behind her it's definitely Alabama what do you think about this whole Alabama Barker and IAB beef what do you think is the real reason behind they're falling out please let me know in the comments down below and don't forget to check out my other videos till next time bye loves

without further Ado let's justjump right to where it all started sofor those of you who don't know Kanye'sfans started noticing that he had beenM.I.A in late 2022 after his majoroutbursts that got him cancellationsleft right and Center a yeah that was adark time for yay fast forward tomid-January 2023 Kanye made a ratherunusual reappearance something wasdifferent about him but his looks asidethere was one more person of interestBianca sensori we would later learn fromTMZ that this was Kanye's new wife likeno one knew this woman she literallycame out of the blue as Kanye's wifewhen he came back from wherever hedisappeared to only to show up besidesyay from wherever he had gone to andthere's a conspiracy she's his Handlerjust take a look at this photo thatemerged in April yeah something was offI totally understand why some peoplefeel that Kanye isn't even Kanye anymoreyou don't have to look too far to noticehow different he is from the yay we knownow he looked spaced out robotic andliterally emotionless just take a lookat what some fans had to say colonierbro been playing God of War or somethingthat ain't yay they cloned him to makematters worse rumors started spreadingaround the same time that this newperson was not Kanye which is why peopleare now convinced that the person we'reseeing is either Kanye's clone or animposter but I don't know about you guysKanye is at a very weird point in hislife and he's definitely going through alot that's not all there's also otherissues which are being discussed a lothis mental health especially after hiscontroversial statements in the pastwhile some people saw physical changesin his cloned version others couldn'thelp but notice how unhappy he lookedhere's what other fans had to say bloodlooks like his mama forced him to take apicture why is he dressed like he's in aretirement home straight out of therapytype fit to understand where thesecloning speculations have come from wemust address the elephant in the roombecause Kanye West wasn't always actinglike this there are allegations ofcontrol and manipulation in theentertainment industry and some believeKanye is a target of such major thingswhen Elon Musk took over Twitter heimmediately reinstated Kanye's accountand whoa did y'all see the bizarremessages from his personal trainerHarley pasternackso it's one of a couple ways first youand I sit down and have a loving andopen conversation but you don't use cusswordsand everything that is discussed isbased in fact and that's some crazystuff that dumb friend of yours told youor you saw the tree second optionI have you institutionalized againwhere they medicate the crap out of youand you go back to Zombieland foreverplay dateplay date with the kids just won't bethe same this message did not sit rightwith me and it got me thinking is Harleyjust a personal trainer or a celebrityHandler so let's talk about this Harleyguy and this cloning thing will makesense I promise there's no way a typicaltrainer would talk to a client like thatwhat does he know that we don't rememberthis is a guy who has worked with quitea number of celebrities who have hadmeltdowns publicly or mysteriously diedof overdosing people like Amy Winehouseand Mac Miller but what's even crazieris that he previously worked in themilitary conducting research onexperimental drugs so working for themilitary I wasn't governed by the samelaws that the typical person was so Icould look at the impact of certaindrugs that are not that or not every dayokay now get this do you remember in2016 when Kanye was checked into apsychiatric hospital After experiencinga meltdown publicly guess who was withhim and even called 9-1-1 Harleypasternack the same guy that's nowsending him such a disturbing text itwas after this incident that Kanye wasdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and puton medicationuh you didn't hear it from me but he wasactually put in zombie mode I clearlyremember how Kanye was a shell ofhimself when he was discharged KanyeWest would be supposedly diagnosed withbipolar disorder and turned into a quotezombie with these haunting photos beingreleased showing a shallow exhaustedlooking game since then heultimate Chatterboxcontroversy honestly guys as much as I'mnot entirely convinced about humancloning I'm not a scientist I kind ofsort of see how Kanye got here theindustry is evil enough to mess withsomeone's brain in case you've forgottenall these things happened around thesame time that Kanye West was working onhis album titled turbo graph x16. take alook at the song titled UCLA where hedocumented what used to happen while hewas admitted to the facility you're madJay take your medjay take your med Jaytake your meds Jay you need some Nikeafter that Kanye has never been the sameagain his erratic behaviors haveactually progressed over time from theoutside looking in we've heard all sortsof stories about how crazy and Shady theindustry is and worse still how theycontrol and eliminate people likeWhitney Houston Kanye has been boldenough to talk about how they wanted tofinish him the same way they did toBritney Spears this leaves me wonderingare they trying to get rid of Kanye Westso you see as outrageous as thesecloning stories are what if someone istrying to get rid of Kanye West what ifthey've done it already and what if theydid something terrible to him such thatpeople can't take him seriously anymoreand rubbish everything he says as Talesof a Madman well Orlando Brown was amongthe people who openly talked about thisboldly saying that there are two Kanye'sthe shorter Kanye and the taller Kanyeif you guys actually realize like likehow there's a taller Kanye and a smallerKanye they're fighting for who's goingto be Kanyethey're fighting for who's gonna beKanye dude right in front of you okay sonow let's shift gears to anotherscandalous part of yay and oh boy can wetalk about his outfits granted his senseof fashion has always been questionablebut this new Kanye is on another levelof absurdity he is literally MakingWaves in the tabloids and Kanye has beenseen wearing some very unusual outfits Imean who is this he was spotted in hisstore with a bushy beard contrary to hissignature clean shave Kanye's recentphotos look nothing like him everyrecent photo or publication about himshows him looking unrecognizable andbehaving funny he wore a gray shirt withred stripes across the chest and anemblem on the side he paired the topwith a tight pair of legging style pantsand green rubber boots that reachedalmost to his knee and if you think thisoutfit was ridiculous here's a strangerone where he went shoeless he wasspotted on a date casually walkingaround in blue socks gross the star wasalso seen wearing shoulder pads underhis shirt photos of the singer wereposted on Kardashian internet Forum towhich many called his look ridiculoushere's what some fans had to say itfeels like he views his entire purposein life as some performative circle jerkit has to be exhausting and is certainlynot good for his already unstable mentalhe looks like a kid who was cut from theteam but refuses to take the practicegear off I think he finds pleasure inthinking he can make any ridiculousoutfit a fashion trend for the maskKanye has a habit of Disappearing andreappearing out of the blue which kindof makes it hard to know if somethingsinister happened during his recentdisappearance or if he's just cloutchasing Kanye double AI robot or clonehowever your theories are has clearlylost Direction when walking into thewall the body language tells us all thisis something elseno that's not him allegedly they can'tdiscuss that it would sabotage theirplatforms okay so we're dying to knowwho is Kanye's new wifeapparently their Affair started as anoffice romance now that Bianca has beenworking at Yeezy since 2020 as head ofarchitecture other than Bianca'ssuspicious entrance into yay's lifepeople also paid attention to his songsensory overload and the lyrics stoodout but guys there's another version tothis some people are saying that Kanyeis the one controlling her I mean isn'tshe literally taking this for better orworse thing too seriously it's one thingfor Kanye to be this controversial Imean it is Kanye West hello however whatthis version of Kanye is putting hiswife through is an entirely new circuslook at her being dragged across thestreet like a pet[Music]and let's not forget that Kanye has beenknown to make his Partners dress up in away that pleases him do you guysremember when he did an entire overhaulof Kim's wardrobe at the time it lookedlike a thoughtful Act of love but nowthat things have come full circle we canconclude that he wanted Kim to dress ina particular way here she accompaniedKanye to church and people have had afield day mocking her not to be rude butI know she got to be sick that Kim K gotall the good clothes and she's walkingaround in a broken black condom thisgotta be Photoshop ain't no way man on alighter note some people said that Kanyeis making her cover her face because shelooks like Pete Davidson KimKardashian's ex-boyfriend what ahilarious Twist of events either waytheir Union has started off amid toomuch controversy is she a wife or aHandler also is it just me or did y'allsee something fishy when Kanye tookBianca shopping at Balenciaga in as muchas Kanye thrives on controversy he hasbeen very local and calling outBalenciaga as well as celebrities thatstill collaborate with Balenciaga andwould you believe me when I tell youthat he turned around and took his wifeshopping at Balenciaga some fans wereconvinced that there was no way the realKanye would step foot in Balenciaga andhere is what they had to say there's noway my dude would

04/02/2023,Lil Kim Reveals How 50 Cent Tried To K!ll Her Career,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0pdsxDWR0E,138-16,it looks like the 50 Cent and Lil Kim Feud is nowhere close to being over after all these years but did Lil Kim really blame 50 Cent for trying to sabotage her career and y'all are not going to believe the crazy stunt 50 Cent pool to try to ruin Lil Kim's reputation honestly I don't even think that we should be surprised at this point because we all know that 50 Cent is the king of pettiness and he has had so many feuds that it's difficult to point out any rapper that 50 hasn't beefed with at one time or another now his beef with Lil Kim has been getting crazier and Crazier by the year and a lot of people don't even know what happened or how it started it's like we just woke up one day and they started attacking each other online and when I say attacking I mean it literally cause child these two ain't got no chill when it comes to dragging each other through the streets of the internet the first time Lil Kim addressed their beef was in 2005 when she told Associated Press I can't front I don't have a lot of respect for 50 Cent because his music is Hardcore violent and I love love his music sometimes but I feel like in his personal life his real life he carries that on and that's not a great message you know what I mean I think he promotes it how can a man have beef with a woman whatever that's just not cool she basically told him to mind the business that pays him and keep her name out of his mouth and knowing 50 Cent he just had to reply and he dissed her in multiple songs even calling her out for her plastic surgery in his song piggy bank he said freak B looked like Kim before the surgery and in his song Love Me he wrapped I thought Lil Kim was hot till she stopped messing with her nose that's not all because in 2021 he made fun of Kim by comparing her to a leprechaun and of course she called him out for being obsessed with her saying you're so obsessed with me is getting creepy this one ain't it bro not funny at all I was hoping to laugh with you but corny boo you falling off I'm too bad and too fly in this video you reaching now but we all know why can we say obsessed with Kimmy much LMAO keep them coming Booboo only lets me know I'm on your brain 24 7. I love it then there's the time he compared her to an owl saying who did this this ain't right lol catch for life on IMDb TV now again Kim hopped in his comments saying stuff like this don't move me one way or another cause I'm still a bad B that men's women's mommies daughters and aunties still want to be till this day and I love it I see you still in your Fields about that dinner date you asked me on that I had to turn down let it go you have a beautiful girlfriend I have a loving husband let it go now this is where we started to get an idea of what actually led to their beef because Kim hinted that 50 had made a move on her but she turned him down and that's why he's been so salty I mean no shade to 50 or anything like that but I think we can all agree that this is the type of thing that he do he's been known to hold grudges for a very long time and do petty things just despite the other person I mean this is the same guy that bought 200 front row tickets to Gyro's concert just to make sure that the seats were empty and make it look like the concert was a failure I mean do y'all know how awkward it would have been for Ja Rule to perform in front of empty seats yeah 50 is petty AF so I can definitely see him still being salty over Kim turning him down then in 2022 things got to a nasty point when 50 tried to incite beef between Nikki and Lil Kim Lil Kim dropped the song with Megan the stallion titled Plan B where she said man user B your father's a b your brother's a b keep acting like this and your son gonna be a b people kind of assumed that she was dissing Nikki in a song you know because of the whole essay thingy about Nikki's husband and her brother plus Nikki and Kim used to have bad blood so people felt like this was a diss well 50 took his chance and tried to start more trouble saying Nicki Minaj you better light her up I'm watching she said something about the baby but her baby eyes messed up I'm not gonna lie it's kind of weird how he brought up Kim's child for no reason especially since he wasn't involved in the drama in the first place talk about a weirdo Lil Kim commented it's okay he's just doing what B men do now watch what God do to his life she also released a statement saying I never said a word about anyone's child please feel free to listen to the song where we were clearly talking about an X to try and twist my words to have an excuse to take digs that my child is disgusting I'm one of the most disrespected Legends in the game but what you will not do is come for my child she also put 50 on blast saying it's so crazy how a song about Beeman could touch a b-man's soul so deeply that he results to attacking a child okay 50 you got me the song was about you she continued I still can't believe y'all can't see through 50s lame disgraceful ugly and narcissistic tactics y'all still falling for that ish he created this whole false narrative to cause drama and confusion because the girl he wanted is getting too much attention this is the second time Kim is talking about how 50 is salty over being rejected and I think that's part of the issue here I mean he did say in his song that he thought she was hot so it makes sense that he would move to her plus he's always the one attacking her first which is certainly weird but it turns out that the rejection is not the entire story because 50 Cent actually tried to ruin Kim's career and that's why the beef is so bitter back in 2003 Lil Kim and 50 Cent collaborated on the song I got the magic stick which quickly became a hit and even peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. Kim was having a successful moment with the song and naturally wanted to film a video but for some reason 50 refused to appear in the video there's a song called Magic Stick 50 you know it was a little Kim song featuring 50 Cent the song became a big song and this was when 50 was on fire song was huge it was one of Kim's biggest songs in quite a while 50 didn't want to do the music video the song was Kim's big return to rap and it was important for her to push the song with a music video so she could fully revive her career but she couldn't exactly do a video without 50 because he had a big part in the song so the planned music video had to be scrapped and this kind of affected the performance of the album because Magic Stick was the most successful single on the album it's not hard to see why Kim would keep a grudge over that but it's kind of wild to see 50 keep attacking her over the years like she's the guilty party someone commented 50 Cent Petty butt been messing with Lil Kim ever since the magic stick Fiasco I can't even listen to the song in my throwback jams no more because he been out of pocket and disrespectful another person said 50 Cent has never been a good person look how he treated his own kid he made fun of little Kim's daughter's looks he talked ish about men all the darn time that man is not above being messy I want to know what y'all think about this messy drama do you think 50 Cent is ever going to stop being messy and get over his beef or do y'all think they both gonna take this drama to the grave and if you think this is messy you're definitely going to love the next video because it's way messier than this one 
03/07/2023,Kanye FUMES Over Daughterâ€™s TikToks..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEO-QSy_fto,112-20,I am her father I know y'all don't respect fathers and the idea of family and media tries to promote something I said I am not allowing my daughter to be used by Tick Tock most men do not there's no such thing as 50 50 custody in society today I spice in Northwest lighted or it was over on the Kim and North Tick Tock page and a lot of people have some mixed opinions about this Duo people are very upset with Northwest for becoming ice spice so a few days ago Kim Kardashian let ice spice come over and film videos with their daughter North now nothing was really wrong with the videos that her and I spice filmed together but now people are seeing it as a problem because North is cosplaying as ice spice she's posted several videos where she's dressed exactly like I spice and she acts like I spice and people are not happy with these videos basically they're saying things like Kanye was right or that North has gone way too far with this and a lot of people are upset with Kim saying that this behavior is not harmless some people are here for it and others are not remember I just wanna play but more importantly Kanye West is being brought into the picture after Northwest was seen posting this Tick Tock that got a lot of controversy this Tick Tock ended up being deleted and it's no longer on North's Tick Tock page baby but there's people that are reposting it everywhere and a lot of people are not so happy with what's going on in this Tick Tock as well as going as for a Sebastian Kim for her parenting style this past week Kanye West's past concerns with Tick Tock as well as him not being able to see his daughter have been resurfacing after his daughter Northwest imitated ice Spice in a tick tock video hey everybody I just got off the phone with Kim I told her to stop antagonizing me with this Tick Tock thing I said it's never again I am her father I know y'all don't respect fathers and the idea of family and media tries to promote something I said I am not allowing my daughter to be used by Tick Tock to be used by Disney uh I have a say-so and then when people say are they going to use this for you in court I don't even I didn't have a say-some whether nothing with the Sierra Canyon most men do not there's no such thing as 50 50 custody with with in society today that's not that's not even it always leans towards the mom but right now and I'm happy that you guys got to see just a small piece of what I dealt with you understand God I just need to protect my CH you protect the children you touch them please God today the devil ain't gonna win you know I'm saying this is gaslighting no you guys may be wondering how Northwest and someone like ice spice would be collabing together there's clearly a huge age difference and yeah well this all started last month when North shared a portrait that she Drew of ice spice on Tech talk I spice has since returned the favor by dancing in a series of videos with North this past week and people were pretty shocked that they actually ended up meeting together and that I spice was able to show up and show some love to North as she was a big fan of her now though northwest's newest series of tick tock posts is really stirring up some conversation uis in a series of posts shared on March 6th literally yesterday North decided to post a tick tock where she's cosplaying I spice she was literally all out wearing the curly orange wig and an eye spice-like outfit while she danced freely to one of her songs and mowed it along to ice spices lyrics which was also another controversial topic people are pointing out how the lyrics seem very explicit especially for someone one like North who's only nine years old to be lip syncing or even mouthing and saying that she shouldn't even have access to this type of music with North just being nine years old that led a lot of people on social media to criticize her after seeing this Tick Tock video of her go viral all of her social media people are saying that she shouldn't be able to meet someone like I spice and there's just a lot being said about this you guys this is exactly why Kanye didn't want his nine-year-old daughter North on social media because you have weirdos like this Kim is a terrible parent a broke clock is right twice a day Kanye was right about not wanting his daughter on Tech talk now she's dressing like I spice and reciting lyrics like that he just a reminder Northwest is nine years old the Kardashians have sons as well yet I never see them plastered all over social media it's almost as if they are explored Northwest for their own gains and trying to mold their daughters into the next generation of Kardashians I might have to side with the outrage on the debate of North Kanye and Isis eight or nine-year-olds making Tech talks to these lyrics someone somewhere should have stopped this discussions continue over on Reddit with a lot of people saying things like I legit feel bad for yay these are the real life fears that have been eating away at him and driving him nuts lately I guarantee it imagine the world waiting with Glee to see your little girl it's horrible fourth grader by the way dang I thought she was a middle schooler already SMH at least North seems to know which parts are not age appropriate so kudos to her but this ain't it yay's punching the air right now Kanye was right once again this is why Kanye didn't want his daughter to have Tick-Tock did she just quote I spice [Music] Kanye's gonna lose his another person said Kanye was right and y'all are just ignorant no way you see an actual child dressing up like this rapper who makes music about cute and funny it's disgusting everyone who called Kanye West crazy owes the brother an apology nord's grandmother has her own daughters out to create a brand so her doing so with grandchildren is no shock some people resurfaced an older video of Kanye that's been going around all over social media where he talks about Tick Tock as well as Northwest his daughter and not being able to see her it was funny I felt like people just they just want to see they want to see somebody melt down they want to see a dad a father a human being they want to see what's going to happen right now if I could be gas lit if I could be pushed to a limit we see now factually that I was asking demanding to see my children and bring them to Sunday service with me because that's you know one of the places they get to be why do I have to even give an explanation but the fact that I was praying online in a public format to suit my children unless you know how out diminish I have been as a father that I could even get to that point because as I was leaving church and my kids wasn't there I was like why should I have to pray to see my children anyways guys this has been what's been going on with Kanye West Kim Kardashian and north and what a lot of people are having to say about her recent Tech talks with ice spice and how North is imitating her I definitely want to know what you guys think about this situation in the comments down below I love you guys so much and as always I'll see y'all thank you [Music]

08/12/2022,The Sad Truth About Doja Cat Shaving Her Hair Off..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiWo5mAi8uE,18-16,um 1 re some people out there accusing doja cat of consuming pills just because she shaved her entire head off damn y'all must crave drama so bad aside from doja cat getting dragged this week for shaving her head off unfortunately kim kardashian and pete davidson also announced their breakup which led to kanye west getting involved and y'all even the euphoria actor jacob elordie received tons of hate after he revealed disturbing information about him that shouldn't have been shared on the internet there's a lot to address in today's video so without further ado let's start with doja cat to be honest i feel like none of y'all are actually willing to give doja cat a break and before anyone comes after me i do want to make it clear that i totally understand the hate she received in the past about the noah schnapp situation and i'm aware of the reason why tons of people came after her and called her out for victimizing noah on live but i do want to go back two years before the noah situation went down because as the majority of you guys know doja has been a well-known troll on social media before she became popular i mean we've all seen her do some funny and crazy stuff during her instagram lives which low-key made her get recognized for having a quirky and bubbly personality on social media however as most of her fan base enjoyed this side of doja some people actually hated it and what i mean by this is so many people started...
07/18/2022,Doja Cat CALLED OUT For Bullying A 17 YEAR OLD..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-RgRWuPPg8,33-20,excuse me but how do people go from praising doja cat straight up canceling her twice within a week no something isn't adding up this time before we address the huge drama dosiacat got involved in which included noah schnapp and amber heard we're gonna dive deep into dojicat's life first and how she managed to become a huge star after she had the biggest celebrity cancellation back in 2020 so without further ado you guys let's jump right in you know doja cat is probably one of the most interesting people that i've seen in the hollywood industry and i don't mean this in a shady way i just wonder how she managed to gain the level of success she has at the moment from a meme video that she posted back in 2018. yeah in case you didn't know doja has been doing music ever since she was 18 years old and she was raised by her mother throughout her childhood as her dad was absent most of the time even though there isn't much background on doja's childhood and the environment she lived in she pretty much found herself making and releasing music which made her gain a bit of attention from some of her followers now i do want to make it clear that doja is one of the celebrities who never seeked fame or attention from anyone since she was just minding her own business creating music for her small fan base while trolling online as usual everything changed when she had a career breakthrough back in 2018. after she went on instagram live and decided to write produce and...
