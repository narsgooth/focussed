12/20/2023,Hailey Bieber Is UPSET With Justin Having A Baby With Kourtney Kardashian?! (itâ€™s bad),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy-5MLL7Yvc,204-11, help with the kids at all or um no only that's the rumor I know y'all are just friends right or are you really dating him we're friends you're friends yes why are you smiling that way Kim tell me about your photo shoot with Justin oh my God it was so much how old is Justin 16 does he have a crush on you I have no idea do you have a crush on him if only he was 18 18 this week the tail is growing in the form of a be baby inside of Courtney's belly or so they say you guys after years of Whispers and rumors haly Bieber finally dropped a bombshell that's got everyone's Jaws on the floor you won't believe what's been going on behind those celebrity curtains so it's actually true that Justin Bieber and Courtney Kardashian's relationship resulted into a little Bieber junor but wait that's not even half of it y'all Justin was playing musical Hearts not just with Courtney but practically made his way through through the Kardashian sisters dating lineup hard as it is to believe Justin Bieber has dated literally all of the Kardashians it gets worse y'all it turns out he even took a dip into the matriarch herself yep there is just so much evidence proving that Chris Jenner also had a thing with Justin Bieber Just when I thought that I had seen it all with these celebrities this is one hell of an interesting yet complicated relationship flowchart guys so without further Ado grab your popcorn and let's get right into This mind-bending Heart twisting jaw-dropping relationship Scandal first of all we need to wind the gossip tape a bit and no actually let's rewind it all the way to the beginning cuz for you to understand what Justin had with Courtney you need to throw it back all the way to 2010 a time when Justin Bieber and the Kardashians first became the ultimate Squad goals at first he was practically the honorary Kardashian brother hitting up all their events like he had a VIP pass to the Kardashian Kingdom videos and picks from back then show that he was practicing L family all cozy and comfy with the Kardashian Crew The Vibes were so strong you guys but hold up remember the Golden Era of jelina for those of you who are still teething jelina was the Romantic relationship between Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez man good old days those were who would have thought jelina wouldn't last every relationship has an expiry date oops I digress let's get back to the topic so yeah it was around 2010 that Justin Bieber and Selena started their relationship and even before the butterflies in their stomachs could settle down Justin was already spreading love like peanut butter on a Kardashian sandwich she was a Non-Stop affection buet and he was the head chef now this explains a lot no wonder Justin and Selena had more breaks than a Kit Kat bar during those eight years breakups makeups and everything in between it's a wonder they didn't break up sooner but hey that's jelina for you back to the cardashian Chronicles the media Buzz started rumors were ripe that Justin was getting cozy with a Kardash Kardashian but here's the plot twist it wasn't Courtney but Kim Kardashian the bombshell dropped after the two attended a White House correspondence dinner and suddenly everyone had a front row seat to the Bieber Kardashian show for a very long time neither of the two ever addressed the issue and in true Kardashian style they milked this story as if their life depended on it but just as this news was beginning to fizzle out Kim and Justin finally decided to address the rumors claiming they were just friends and we were like friends who cuz let's be there was just too much PDA then a high school dance being touchy touchy spending literally all of their time together and all but hey if they say they were just friends we had to roll with it meanwhile Justin's career was skyrocketing making him the perfect figure to be seen around the Kardashians cuz you all know how Chris Jenner has been taking advantage of such moments to keep her girls relevant and so it goes without saying that Justin was still a permanent fixture in Kardashian land post Kim era Justin Bieber now pivoted to the Jenner Sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner attending parties festivals TV shows and other events you know just keeping it in the Family Y all know how Kim is always the Mastermind of eyebrow raising stories and at some point she even said in an interview that back when Justin was a freshfell was just 14 she thought they would be the hottest teen couple the world has ever seen and so in kashian style she tried to link them up I think actually before that I had said in an interview that I wanted to set him up with my sister uh Kendall who's 14 and and then he had responded in an interview saying that um no he didn't want to be hooked up with my sister he liked me or something just silly like that it was a joke anyways for someone who had hooked up with her sister's boyfriend in the past Kim didn't have any problem running around town with Justin now that he said he preferred her to Kendall on top of that there's a video of Justin speaking to someone behind the scenes confessing he's feeling all sorts of Vibes and apparently that person was Kendall Jenner me are you yeah cuz you're sitting right there oh did if it was Kendall and from the way that they're talking it's not just a casual chat these are people who have been romantically involved in one way or another if you catch my draft now just when we thought that we had hit the climax rumors started swirling that Justin might have also had a thing with Kylie around 2014 but none of them have ever addressed those rumors and as if that's not enough there were even crazier matters as it looks like in 2014 there was definitely quite an eventful year for Justin in the scorching Summer of the same year Hollywood wasn't just heating up from the Sun the sizzling drama between Courtney Kardashian and Justin Bieber was turning up the temperature and it was a wildfire of emotions that would leave everyone talking for years to come by this time the fabric that held Justin and Selena's relationship was growing weaker and weaker one moment they were the picture perfect couple gold ready to walk down the aisle and the next day it was as if they had tossed it to the Wolves interestingly enough Selena and Justin weren't the only ones whose relationship was hanging by a thread Courtney Kardashian and Scott DX's Union was literally on its last legs after a series of multiple spin-offs I mean Scott was out here getting it on with models so maybe Courtney decided to prove a point too and so she went and hooked up with young Justin I mean how else do you get back at your cheating partner than dating one of the greatest musicians of all time guys this was a true illustration that misery loves company because Courtney and Justin decided to mourn their Rocky Relationships by giving each other a shoulder to lean on cuz they would hook up anytime they were experiencing relationship stormy days with their respective Partners call it fate or just a Twist of Hollywood irony but yeah that's how this whole Courtney Justin thing started let me tell you the paparazzi had a fielded day with them it didn't help that they were always together so proving their Affair was super easy like when proparazzi swamped around them while leaving the nice guy a go-to celebrity chill in Hollywood they tried the Cloak and Dagger routine arriving separately but who were they kidding when you always sit together and leave together the chick is up in a separate incident they were also spotted together at Universal Studios and soon after the plot thickened what started as an innocent shoulder leans escalated into a fullblown romantic affair they started sending subtle confirmations like Justin would put his armor on Courtney but all the rumors and speculations were confirmed when the two spent the night at the Beverly Hills Hotel Hotel no more separate entrances they stormed in United and left the next day leaving the gossip Mills to run their mouths I don't know about y'all but people had connected the dots by this time as if that wasn't enough they kind of enjoyed the media attention cuz our boy juston knew how to drop teases on Instagram at one point he dropped a cryptic pick with an unidentified woman but the caption spilled the te he wrote Lord knows Justin was literally firing shots towards Courtney's ex Scott dick CU he's the one who calls himself the Lord in fact when Justin was put on the spot about the whole Courtney Kardashian situation in an interview his response was I'm being used man what can I say when the host probed further asking him if there was much to their closeness he said no we'll leave it at that dtin Bieber 21 getting ego boost from Romancing Hot Mom Courtney Kardashian 36 and doesn't care he's being used to hurt Scott D you're being used dude I'm being used man what can I say yes anything there nothing no we'll leave it at that okay see the look no no for real no she's uh she's she's great yeah not only that but Justin was also seen warming up to Courtney's kids which even made people suspect them more let's not forget Justin had always had this dream of settling down being a young dad and having mini beavers running around by the age of 26 now with this Courtney and her crew it looked like Justin had his dream come to pass at least at the time anyways all good things come to an end and so did this wild romance Justin and Courtney went their separate ways with Justin marrying Haley Baldwin and Courtney getting on with Travis Barker nonetheless these two left a trail of Gossip that has followed them up to date fast forward to 2018 literally around the time Justin and Haley married the celebrity gossip Mill was buzzing yet again with unexpected news Justin's wife barely enjoyed the honeymoon cuz she soon found herself caught in a situation she had absolutely nothing being a part of it seemed like even though Justin and Courtney had moved on from their short-lived fling the universe had other plans rumors started swirling about Courtney Kardashian having a baby and shockingly the speculation pointed towards none other than Justin as the potential father we're now down to some math guys cuz if you look at the timeline of Justin and Courtney's relationship it totally makes sense people started saying that since Courtney had her son reain in December 2014 maybe just maybe Justin Bieber was the father and that they'd likely hooked up in one of their on andof situationships with their other partners people further ruled out the possibility of Scott DK being the father because in late 2013 early 2014 Courtney and dik didn't see eye to eye it was also around this time that Courtney and Justin were all over each other like when they spent the night at the Beverly Hills Hotel as soon as Courtney announced her pregnancy the blogs went into overdrive Insider Secrets claimed that Courtney's friends had confirmed that Justin was the father by this time Courtney was 36 and Justin was only 22 y'all according to the inside sources Courtney already admitted to friends that she and Justin have been intimate and she hasn't been with Scott in a long time so the math is pretty clear it would have to be a beaver baby the informant also added that Justin wanted to be a father and was already telling friends that the Kardashians were already like family remember Courtney was 36 and Justin was only 22 y'all when baby rain was born fans went into detective mode trying to compare him to Justin's baby pictures and to be honest There Were Striking similarities well some rubbished these claims saying that people were just reaching until Scott di requested a paternity test for baby writing that's when people knew there was more than what met the eye another reason why people believed the kid wasn't D six was based on his reaction when Courtney told him she was pregnant the Dude Looks like he's doing quick math in his head questioning whether they were even together when the store came knocking suspicion levels soring but here's where it gets crazier and people's suspicions went through the roof Scott D started feeling some type of way and just to clear the doubts he requested a paternity test but guess what Courtney flat out refused fans were like why the mystery Courtney especially because back in 2010 she didn't hesitate to do a test for their firstborn Mason because apparently Courtney was seeing some model so it beats logic that she didn't hesitate the first time and yet on this second instance she put her foot down that the paternity test wasn't happening this family furthermore it was super uncommon for the Kardashians to be silent about such issues I mean they're the Masters of turning drama into Dollars usually ready to spill the beans on every little thing for those sweet reality show views we've seen them turn everything into an episode from wardrobe malfunctions to who ate the last snack kind of drama but when it came to Justin and Courtney's mysterious Affair radio silence the Kardashians would have melted this for all its denials dramatic confrontations maybe a tier or two you know the drill this story was a reality show gold mine but not a Zitch they didn't touch it with a 10t selfie stick the only logical explanation why the Kardashians would be so hush hushed with such info would be to protect their image and maybe Justice it's not like the Kardashians are the poster family for Sunday school or the role model family you look up to I mean they've shown us all forms of scandals over the years literally from the disturbing tape that got them to Fame in the first place if anything the Kardashian Empire has been built on drama right from the onset that launched their startup however Remember by the time this was happen happening they were now a Powerhouse family with businesses Brands and a name to safeguard especially in this cancel culture era so they weren't about to let anything mess with their money flow Justin being 22 and Courtney being 36 didn't help matters at all another reason why they may have decided to keep quiet about the issue was to protect the innocent baby uh the Kardashians might not have been putting protection on the baby on the top of their priority list but it's still a thing trolls on social media can be nastier than a bad breakup playlist imagine the end cyber drama that kid would face it would have been a never-ending Floodgate Of online chaos you guys now let's talk about Justin the dude had a lot on his plate tours albums and being the teen heartthrob confirming this kind of thing to the public would have been a setback for him so for years crickets none of the involved parties dared whisper about it now even though the Kardashian Bieber Vault may have been sealed tight The Whispers have lingered for years and without a doubt Justin sampled all of that however you might want to take a see because this whole Saga took a detour in a mindboggling zone so get this Justin Bieber might have had a thing with none other than Chris Jenner the Kardashian matriarch I know I know I've been tiptoeing around the word relationship because let's be real it's like trying to understand a new Snapchat filter confusing as heck but there's proof that Justin got a little comfy with Chris Jenner Justin Bieber once dropped a Father's Day bomb on us with a picture of him hugging Chris Jenner from behind with the caption who's your daddy at Kendall at Kylie from where I sit maybe this was just some cheeky joke in a fun moment but there's definitely some depth as far as Jus and the Kardashians are concerned the Kardashians are the kind of people who' literally make you want to be a fly on the wall just to understand exactly what's going on like did they share dad jokes or was there some deeper connection we're not quite getting cuz this was one hell of a confusing situation okay even without reading too much into it not many people would be comfortable hugging their girlfriend's mother like that anyway what do I know all right moving on swiftly fast forward to 2023 and this drama is still on Guess Who finally spilled the tea Haley Bieber dropped some major hints on the case y'all first of all I hope poor Haley gets some sort of hardship allowance because she has been through it in this marriage from Selena Gomez beef to Fan drama her beauty company controversies her modeling gigs and that's not even starting on her marriage anyways Haley recently told a friend if I would get pregnant through an fair I wouldn't tell anybody well considering Courtney and Justin's relationship F started putting one plus one together confirming that rain is Justin's kid but it also totally made sense why the issue had been kept under WS for years not only that but apparently Haley straight up banned Justin from getting anywhere near Courtney Kardashian according to the inside scoop one of the rules Justin and Haley have put in place to maintain a strong marriage is not hanging out with Courtney Kardashian says that Haley enforced this rule after they got engaged back in 2018 now now why would Haley feel the need to drop the hammer on Justin and Courtney's relationship like that come on that isn't the only woman Justin has been with in the past so for Haley to feel so threatened it must have been so serious the article says that Justin and Courtney really connected on a soul level and if that doesn't sound like a love spell I don't know what is on second thoughts it absolutely makes sense why Haley would set such a rule in addition at the time Haley laid down the law Courtney was fresh out of a relationship and now that she was single nothing was stopping her from going after Justin one more time the question on everyone's mind is is it normal for people in a healthy relationship to set such rules what happened to trusting and respecting your partner this spoke so much to the nature of Haley and Justin's relationship because it now comes off as if haey has little to no say in their marriage and important things like faithfulness and why she works to dictate some rules to Justin another reason why Haley could be more insecure about courtne is because of her concern about having kids haly has in the past been open about her desire to have kids but said that even then she's super scared in an interview with Sunday time syy said I want kids but I get scared I literally cry about this all the time I want kids bad but I get scared it's enough that people say things about my husband or my friends I can't imagine having to confront people saying things about a child haly went on to add that raising a kid is such a challenging Affair and that the best a parent can do is just try to raise them we can only do the the best we can to raise them as long as they feel loved and safe anyways fans are still divided on the issue some are convinced that it's true While others say it's just Classic Hollywood celebrity smoke gossip I remember them seeing each other and yes I strongly believe that is Justin's kid if that is his son then hopefully he will stand up and that little boy deserves to know who his real father is even if it's true do you realize how damaging it must be for that young boy to be hearing this especially from his peers Courtney said I'll give rain a DNA test when Chris gives Chloe one on the flip side other people expressed their concerns over the Kardashians and other people using Justin Bieber when he was just a kid unpopular opinion Justin Bieber was groomed by every adult around him it always felt weird how she loves to hang out around barely legal celebs like Addison Ray and Justin Bieber Etc it's giving midlife crisis mixed with immaturity and manipulation I hope one day Justin will write a book slake a documentary about everything that's happened to him and all the mistreatment and abuse he faced as a big fan it was so hard watching the light leaving his eyes and everyone making fun of him looking the way he does those people clearly don't know what trauma and mental issues can do to people that's the messy situation about this whole Kardashian Bieber love Saga it's a roller coaster that started way back when flip phones were cool let me know your thoughts on this situation and keep it here as I bring you more tea on these celebrities and influencers
ad,ad: LET'S GO! We Tried EVERY Lay's Chip Flavor,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lscFJ0peRGA,0-20,27 Flavors of Lays but only one can be the best.  Let's talk about that. (groovy music) Good mythical morning.  We all know the Lay's slogan bet you can't eat just one but we're pretty sure there are a whole bunch of Lay's flavors we can eat just one of.  Well speak for yourself.  We're gonna be tasting Lay's potato chip flavors every single one under the sun to find out what the best one really is.  Mythical beasts we cordially invite you to rip open all 27 bags of Lay's chips with us today in order to crown the true chip king. It's time for Gut Check Lay's Chips Edition.  I'm always hungry from some chips Stevie.  [Stevie] You know the drill. The mythical crew has acquired every available Lay's chip flavor for you to try in rapid succession today. After you try each flavor you'll give it a score of one to 100 based on your gut reactions. Then you'll taste the top four to determine which Lay's chip flavor deserves the top title of All That and a Bag of Chips.  And these are just the American ones. We've had the international Lay's many different ways but this is the first time we've eaten all of the Lay's that we can find here. It seems like we should've already done this.  [Stevie] And in fact I had that very thought and went and made sure that I wasn't losing it.  We have to do that quite a bit. Have we don't this before?  [Stevie] There's a whole library. The search thing on YouTube works. If at any point your palette's need a refresh we have some Bubly brand sparkling water ready for you in one of our mythical sip and slide slippers. And you might be asking why is this not Topo Chico? Well it's because Bubly brand water is a PepsiCo product and PepsiCo owns FritoLay. So we're keeping it incestuous up in here like we always do.  It's not as good as Topo Chico.  Keeping it incestuous.  [Stevie] Let's kick things off. Well actually no let's kick things off with your chart.  Yep I got a pomato farm.  Pomato?  Please no tomatoes. Link's Ranking Potato Farm 'cause that's what chips are made out of.  You find the potato that you most relate to.  It starts at zero ends in 100 I'm ready.  And of course I mean at this point guys I know I've been requesting my own visual aid in order to keep up with Link here but I kind of am just being assaulted one time after another at this point. You couldn't even call it a potato farm you called it a tayto ferm. You jerks.  I can be just like Link.  [Stevie] Why is that written in first person? All right we're gonna kick things off with every flavor of the traditional Lay's chip style beginning with Classic.  Hmm.  Oh.  That's a good chip man.  It's so thin it's light it's buttery it's salty it's so perfect.  81.  Good gosh I've gotta give it an 89.  [Stevie] Barbecue.  Okay.  Oh we got foldies. We both got foldies.  Yeah we did. Tangy.  Wow I don't often reach for barbecue.  It's tangy to my thingy  But it really did you stick it down your pants when I wasn't looking?  My thingy is my tongue.  Okay well keep it in your mouth.  I'm not a fan.  I like it more than I so you seemed like you were I think this is just I'll take just a moment to address  I like to be positive at first.  To address something.  [Stevie] This is the second chip flavor and here we are.  I saw a number of people recently talk about Link's tendency to seem like he's having a positive reaction and then give something like a 20. Well here's what we have done just so you know to accommodate for you because I agree with you he's crazy. When we get to our final four we're gonna have our combined final four but just so you can know what a sensible person thinks you'll know what my favorite flavor was just in case you're also a sensible person and you want to like have a vibe like a sensibility vibe you're gonna know what my favorite is if that's the thing that you wanna buy okay?  And if you want to tap into my vibe I'll tell you what my favorite flavor is too. Now I'm still gonna give it a 59.  Okay.  I'm gonna give it a 66.  [Stevie] Sour cream and onion.  Oh yes.  Now we're on record saying this is the best chip many years ago.  88.  That's good. I'm gonna give that a 90.  [Stevie] Salt and vinegar.  Salt and vinegar. This one reminds me of my wife.  Man you like to rub salt and vinegar on her?  No this is her favorite chip.  Oh. Well you should look into it 'cause we do that.  We do that.  Sunday is salt Saturday is vinegar.  Vinegar.  It's all on the weekend. Salty Sunday we call it.  I'm gonna give it a 63.  Wow. I really really like this. I like it so much I'm gonna give it an 84.  [Stevie] Sweet southern heat BBQ.  Oh.  That's a lot of words.  That's new to me. Not nearly as sweet by the way  Or as hot.  As the regular barbecue. The heat starts coming now.  So it's a little spicy but not a lot of barbecuing.  I wasn't a huge fan of just the flavor of that 61.  No.  No.  36 for me.  [Stevie] Honey barbecue.  Okay.  It's worse than barbecue. I actually actively dislike this one 48.  I like it better than barbecue but you guilted me into giving barbecue too high of a score.  Out of sight out of mind man.  Yeah I would like to amend it but I can't this is a Gut Check. I think I gave it a 59 I'm gonna give this a 60.  [Stevie] Chile limon.  Huh?  Chile limon.  Okay. Okay Lay's.  Hold on. Uh uh. This should be this should be on a tortilla chip this shouldn't be on a Lay's chip.  It doesn't mix as well with the potato you're right about that but it was so unexpected and oh it's got a nice little spicy thing happening.  It is spicy and limony.  77.  20.  [Stevie] Limon.  So this is just the lime flavor with no spice.  It belongs on a tortilla.  Not as good.  This is so this is wrong.  I still like the tang though 63.  18.  [Stevie] Dill pickle.  Oh I need to.  I need to I need to.  You sensed the same thing that limon.  Got to get rid of that limon. Okay V hit me.  Mmm this brings to me everything that salt and vinegar brings but then a dill pickle flavor which I really like.  Yeah that's interesting.  90.  I don't know if I'd eat a whole bag in one sitting. 90 good God man.  I love it.  That's crazy man. 49.  [Stevie] Flamin hot dill pickle.  Oh no!  Did you know that was a thing?  I didn't. Can I get another one of those? That was a small one.  That was a small one. Are they all small?  Yeah why are they so small? What happens to the what?  What happens? That's better than the dill pickle right? It's a hot dill pickle.  I thought I was gonna like it more than the dill pickle but the hotness is actually taking away from the dillness and I don't know if I'm into the dill or to the hot.  Yeah you've swayed me 47.  I don't think it's bad. I'm gonna give it a solid 80.  [Stevie] Adobadas.  Aho octopus?  [Stevie] Adobadas but the woman on Google says adobadas.  Adobadas.  [Stevie] Adobadas.  What does that mean?  It means you're automatically a badass.  Pork marinated in chili.  Oh.  Okay.  The chili powder is very very chili powder forward. Almost has a Fritolike quality to it because of that like a chili cheese Frito.  Yeah I expect it on a Frito.  I like this but not a lot 59.  I'm gonna give it a 44.  [Stevie] And that concludes the traditional adobadas category. Next up is the Wavy category beginning with original.  So this is kind of like where they were like I'll see your Ruffles and I'll raise you with bigger ridges.  You know one of the things that happens during these taste tests is this isn't a typical experience. Like having eaten all those and then eating this is not how you typically enjoy chips.  Right.  So the crunch is actually more welcomed than the ridges usually would be for me personally.  It is the most structurally sound chip that we're gonna taste today.  But is it too strong? We're not building things with it we're just eating it.  I mean you could dip it in some of that chip dip stuff.  And it won't break.  And that's so good that's so good.  I really do like it.  'Cause when you have like the thin ones you just have to put it down and pull it back up there's no scooping.  But when I think of Lay's I think of they perfected the thin chip and I think it would be spiritually wrong for their rigid chip to be better than their thin chip.  I don't like it as much as a Ruffle.  75 it's good 75.  37.  [Stevie] Funyuns onion.  I'm listening.  They did a crossover with Funyons?  That's nice.  Man 86.  That's gotta go 70.  [Stevie] Hickory barbecue.  Hickory.  I like that better than the other two barbecues but I don't know a lot of people love barbecue but  I don't love barbecue chips as much I don't know 'cause I like to eat chips with yeah I like barbecue on other things 61.  70.  [Stevie] Lightly salted.  Just lightly salted that's all?  [Stevie] Mmhmm.  It's missing something.  A little salt is it missing a little salt?  The rest of the salt.  Yeah.  14.  It is pretty dang bad 21.  [Stevie] And that concludes the wavy category. The next category is Lay's Stax with an X.  Now how does that work? Is this when they're getting in on Pringles?  [Stevie] Yeah.  Let's see it.  [Stevie] And we're starting with original.  Hold on you can't just  They don't need to do this.  I think we might need to refuse to eat it. Oop too late okay. It is a Pringle.  We all know that what you're doing is just taking all of the offings from your tater slicing process turning it into mush and then forming a chip. You're taking the trash from your factory Lay's and you're selling it to us.  I don't think you need to be that hard on 'em. I think they  It's trash.  You caught them redhanded just copying Pringles and that was bad enough.  Pringles are trash. Pringles buys the trash from other chip manufacturers and then turns it into a Pringle.  What about when Pringles wants to sponsor us?  Well then I'll change my tune.  [Rhett] Okay.  10.  27.  [Stevie] Sour cream and onion.  Well  The flavor does a lot for it.  That's some tasty trash.  Does it come in a canister? Same thing?  Yeah and it's like oblong. It's not round it's more oblong.  Can they sue?  Ovalish. They can't sue 15.  I thought that was pretty good actually I'm gonna give that a 58.  [Stevie] Mesquite barbecue.  There's lots of kinds of barbecue.  They're thicker than a Pringle.  You got honey you got mesquite you got Hickory.  13.  38.  [Stevie] Cheddar.  Oh.  Okay. This is weird I'm torn.  I'm gonna give it 56 and I'm gonna blow my nose.  I'm gonna give it a 19.  [Rhett] Pay no mind to me. Look away make a distraction.  I'm looking at V she broke her nose in college. I'm seeing if I can tell.  Did I give that a score?  [Stevie] Yes you did you said 56 confidently.  Wow.  [Stevie] Salt and vinegar.  That's my fault.  What happened?  Hit the tooth.  Oh really?  Like hit the gum line. That's how much I missed it.  [Link] I bet that hurt. That's an 11 for me.  I like that okay 62.  [Stevie] Bacon and cheddar potato skins.  Bacon flavor is so hard to do.  They're throwing so much stuff at these trash chips.  That's actually not a bad bacon flavor. It can go so wrong with a bacon flavor.  Yeah.  I'm gonna give you a 51 I just like it a little bit.  I'm gonna give you a 17 'cause I'm not giving anything that's trash over a 20.  Okay.  [Stevie] Buffalo wings with ranch.  Why don't you put this on a chip that's actually a chip?  I don't know these are growing on me the more I have 'em.  It's 'cause you've forgotten.  Yeah I forgot what a regular Lay's tastes like it's been so long.  18.  59.  [Stevie] Extra flamin' hot.  Extra flamin' hot?  Are you smelling each one of these before you give it to me? Outta the corner of my eye it seems like you put it up to your nose your broken nose.  Are you smelling it too?  [K.G.] No.  K.G.'s not smelling it.  She's sniffing it and feeding it to me.  [V] My nose is fine.  It seems weird.  She's making sure it's not poison.  Okay.  Could you do that for mine?  Oh that's hot.  I don't know the crunch it's just a cumulative effect. 72 I'm starting to like these.  Don't be stupid.  I'm just telling you and it's hot it worked.  I feel threatened.  Okay.  11 11.  You're gonna give it less than a 20 so it doesn't really matter.  It's trash man.  It's not that bad.  If you stay in a dumpster long enough you start to call it home.  Hmm okay.  And that concludes the Stax category. On to our final category Lay's Poppables beginning with sea salt and vinegar.  Sea salt.  Now this is some form of like 3D printed lattice. Huh?  It's like a Chex it's a Chex.  An overblown Chex.  What do you call one Chex a check? It's a check and it's not good and I can't taste anything except like wheat.  That one's an 8.  It's not great guys. I'm afraid to give you single digits so I'll give you a 10.  [Stevie] It is potato by the way so it's interesting that you're tasting wheat.  Well I don't know it's just something about there's so much air in there.  Yeah it's like a cereal gimme another one.  Most of it's air Stevie.  [Stevie] Sea salt.  Oh this is gonna be worse.  Come on.  [V] Sorry.  What do you mean?  [V] You said sea salt.  Sea salt.  [V] Wait. (crew laughing)  You should see all the sniffing she's doing over there.  You know what? It doesn't matter he's gonna hate it.  [V] No it's cause I had grabbed the second one sorry.  This is actively horrible. I'm sorry like how did this get made? Maybe if you were alone and lonely and also this was all you had and it was day seven.  8.  I'm gonna give it a 9 I'm sorry.  Ew.  [Stevie] Wait did you say seven? Rhett you said something that sounded like seven.  Yeah I said you had been alone for seven days.  [Stevie] Oh okay sorry sorry sorry seven but you're giving it a nine?  Oh I'm sorry I shouldn't use numbers unless I'm using scoring. I'm 45 forget that for a second.  [Stevie] White cheddar.  Oh.  White cheddar white.  [K.G.] I think I gave you white cheddar already but here's a  Oh you gave me white cheddar?  [K.G.] Yeah here you go sorry.  One job. Pick up a chip put it in our mouths. Is that two jobs?  I was wondering why that sea salt one tasted like cheese but I wasn't gonna say anything.  That's why it tasted so bad?  [K.G.] They all look the same.  I'll tell you.  It doesn't matter trust me.  The trust of the people is eroding.  What did I give the last one?  [Stevie] I'll move your nine down to this one. Wait could you guys.  [V] You said sea salt twice that's why.  [Stevie] No sea salt and vinegar was one and then sea salt was the other one.  Let me try just sing salt sing salt.  [Stevie] So we're gonna move Rhett's other nine down and Link what score did you give?  No this is what we're gonna do.  [Stevie] Okay.  We're gonna start over.  No come on! No come on give me just sea salt.  Eight I'm giving it an eight.  [Stevie] And then now this is Rhett's retroactive sea salt taste.  Rhettroactive.  Nine.  [Stevie] Okay so you've both scored sea salt and white cheddar the exact same scores?  Yes.  That was I think that was kind of a joke there was humor in that.  No there was no humor in it. It was humorless.  [Stevie] Are we ready for honey barbecue?  [V] Yes.  Yeah yeah I think we can take it.  [Stevie] Let's do it.  [Crew] Oh. (crew laughing)  God.  Hey I like the bit y'all got going. That was good timing. Comedy's timing I'm telling you or lack thereof sometimes.  Two big old two for that one.  I don't know 13.  [Stevie] And that concludes the final category.  Thank God.  [Stevie] You have now tasted all of the available Lay's chip flavors. Your scores will now be tabulated so you may more closely judge the top four flavors. (upbeat music)  Before we reveal our top four flavors I would like to draw your attention to the sweatshirt I'm wearing.  [Link] That's a nice sweatshirt.  It's so comfy.  I think this is the softest sweatshirt we've ever sold and that's a cool fun musical design.  Do you know what it is Link?  It's the GMM theme song.  That's right.  And it's actually playable this is correct and there's lots of little Easter eggs here least of which is not me as a chocolate fountain but it's totally appropriate get this thing at mythical.com. Also we're having a cold weather flash sale March 27th through the 31st. We're giving up to 20% off our cold weather gear hoodies sweatshirts it's a good time to grab some of that stuff mythical.com?  Yes.  [Stevie] Okay according to you the top four Lay's chips in no particular order are Funyun's Onions Wavy Classic Salt and Vinegar Sour Cream and Onion.  Of course.  [Stevie] And before you taste these collective top four Rhett your favorite flavor was dill pickle no surprise there  So you feel good about giving it its moment in the sun here?  Yes there it is. Guys okay you know who you are my favorite was the dill pickle. It has its moment and we can move on.  [Stevie] And Link yours was sour cream and onion.  Yeah it was. So do we want to I think we should taste the sour cream and onion before the Funyuns.  What about starting with the classic though? I mean you want to start with no flavor at all right? And then maybe work our way back down.  It's a perfect chip.  It's still great.  If you want a chip and you don't know what else you want you're not gonna be hurt. Your feelings are gonna be fine with that.  Solid chip.  And then if you throw I do question making the onion so prominent on the packaging.  Well you know what it depends on how you look at it. Right now I can't even see it.  Okay.  Man still very very tasty.  It's mild it's fabulous.  These were surprising.  Yeah I know. If they put this on a thin chip it might be the hands down winner.  I think the reason they put it on a ridged chip is because they're going for the crunch that you would get from a Funyun you know?  I can buy that woo.  They're good man.  That's good. I mean it's so much stronger than the sour cream and onion.  This is so unexpected. I didn't know I'd be in wavy land.  I don't think this should be in contention.  [Rhett] You haven't even tasted it yet.  I've tasted it before. It's good it's top four material but  I like it ultimately I like this the least just because it doesn't have any flavor. I'm saying I like it the least of the four that we have up here.  Oh really? No no no I can't I can't I can't.  Your favorite is already up here.  I'm gonna give you  Your favorite is already up here.  Yeah but you talked about the pickle that was your moment.  Yeah but yours is already up here.  Dude this is amazing it's classic.  It is classic okay it's classic. Hey you know who you are these should be on the pedestal okay just.  I'm having a crisis of conscience here because we've been on record saying this is the best chip.  That doesn't matter. I change my mind all the time.  It's a dead heat for me man. It's a dead heat. I mean clearly the wavy Funyuns have more crunch and they have more flavor.  It's a dead heat?  Yeah.  I'm sorry guys.  Oh you did it?  Sour cream and onion's still the best one the tang you can't I just can't get over the tang. I'm sorry so All That and a Bag of Chips is sour cream and onion flavored Lay's.  Ah.  Oh there's more.

09/22/2023,Joe Jonas Is In More Trouble (sued by sophie turner),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsWk9JqS7zs,195-11, Joe Jonas is in even more trouble after filing for divorce from Sophie Turner we recently talked about how Joe had been facing major backlash from the public and fans because of what had come out in the Press from close sources to him in regards to the couple's split people felt like Joe and his team were trying to make Sophie look bad painting her out to look like an absent parent who had up and left Joe with their two daughters when in reality she was just working in the UK filming a new project but once their divorce news hit the press it seemed like every other day source is close to him had a new statement to say that made Sophie look worse and worse but I'm telling you guys fans were not falling for it and I talked about it at the time that Joe just kept receiving so much backlash because people could not believe the things that he was letting come out about her but now Sophie's side of the situation is being told after court documents were filed Thursday in New York by her to have her children return to England and the most shocking statement to come from the document might just be the fact fact that Sophie claims she learned about Joe filing for divorce through the Press it's a crazy situation that only seems to get crazier and the court documents are detailing a very messy custody battle as the two can't seem to come to an agreement about where their children will be living it sounds like the two of them had agreed upon something prior to their divorce but now it's alleged Joe seems to have maybe changed his mind NBC reported Thursday that actor Sophie Turner has sued pop star Joe Jonas for the return of their two young children to England saying in the filing Jonas will not turn over the kids passports they went into further detail of the current situation at hand writing the petition stated that the Game of Thrones star and Jonas brother singer made England their permanent home in April after much discussion and a desire to have the children attend school in England they moved into a rental on a long-term basis in May and entered contracts to purchase a home in July with a plan to move there in December the filing said but the couple's relationship was apparently strained by complicated travel Arrangements over the summer they decided that as Turner started filming a new Drama Series in the UK in May the children would travel with Jonas and a nanny as he kicked off his tour with the Jonas Brothers in the United States in Late July apparently the plan was that the kids were going to stay with Joe and his family until Sophie finished filming and then she would come back to New York in September to come get the girls and take them to the UK but things have just become such a mess because of this divorce documents claim the two of them had an argument last month that led Joe to file for divorce at the beginning of this month and in the papers Sophie is claiming that she did in fact learn about him filing for divorce through the media which if true is just horrible a horrible way to find out that your husband has filed for divorce is through the Press that's for sure and something crazy that people have pointed out was that the day before the news had hit the press that he filed for divorce he had posted a photo on Instagram wearing his wedding and this photo came from the Jones Brothers show the day before which was one of the first shows that he had worn his bring at in a very long time which people thought was to shut down rumors but obviously not so people were just like was he wearing the ring because she didn't even know they were getting a divorce and then the next day boom Blindside or why what was the point of him wearing the ring at this one particular show was to like tease her or you know what was the deal but I will say that Joe and his team are denying the fact that Sophie found out about the news through the media they're claiming that she already knew about this before it hit the Press who knows what the situation is but that is what each side is saying now it's important to note that when Joe filed for divorce he did so in Florida and at the time he said that the children were residing in Florida with him for six months prior to the divorce which according to the documents that Sophie filed in court she's claiming that that is just not true but since he filed in Florida the state's law restricts both parents from relocating the children during the divorce process or at least until custody can be figured out but things get a little complicated because the children have dual citizenship and according to NBC on September 17th Turner and Jonas met to discuss their separation and Turner reiterated their agreement for the children to return to England that week the petition stated that Jonas was in possession of the children's passports but refused to hand them over and send them with Turner back to England the petition was filed after Jonas allegedly refused to let the children go with their mother which is a breach of the mother's rights of custody under English law England being the children's habitual residence the petition stated that the children who have dual citizenship are fully involved and integrated in daily life in England with the older child attending school and both involved in play dates and cultural activities Turner has requested the return of her children to England has submitted her application for return with the central Authority for England and Wales and says that she never consented or acquiesced to the removal of the children from England the court documents said the petition was filed through the child abduction Clauses of the Hague convention an international treaty adopted by more than 100 countries including the U.S which aims to compel the return of a child taken by their parent from their country of Habitual residence now that Sophie is back from filming she is in New York currently with the girls and the situation is clearly just such a mess since all of this has come out Joe Jonas's team has since put out a statement on his behalf to NBC and him and his team are obviously not happy in the statement that they gave because obviously these core documents are talking about abduction you know returning his children so him and his team are trying to shut all of these things down his team is saying that they hope Sophie reconsiders her harsh legal position and moves forward in a more constructive and private manner which the private manner part is just so interesting given the fact that Joe and his team have been very loud in the Press which is the reason why he was getting a lot of backlash in the beginning when he first filed for divorce because everyone just felt like why is he making it so public why is he slashing her in the headlines like what is this going on well obviously now the tables have turned and Joe isn't looking too hot in the core documents that Sophie has filed which are public record and suddenly his team want privacy privacy privacy the statement also claims that Joe and Sophie met last Sunday in New York to discuss how they were going to move forward with co-parenting and that Joe was under the impression that they had reached a mutual understanding but less than 24 hours later Sophie said that she wanted the children to permanently be moved to the UK in a statement to NBC Joe's team also said thereafter she demanded via this filing that Joe hand over the children's passports so that she could take them out of the country immediately if he complies Joe will be in violation of the Florida court order the statement said Joe is seeking shared parenting with the kids and is of course also okay with the kids being raised both in the U.S and the UK Joe's team is claiming that Sophie is making this production claim only to have the divorce play out in the UK and to have the children removed from the US and is denying all of that saying that calling in an abduction is just misleading now like I said this whole thing is just crazy and for two people who put out a joint statement on their Instagram saying that you know they're speculative narratives and that they're United in their decision the things being said by them in the court documents seem to say otherwise and it literally could not be more of a mess in a loud public one at that for two people who wished privacy during this time in their Instagram statement I mean all eyes have certainly been on these two with a lot of people still feeling negatively about Joe in all of this his Instagram comments reflect such as he's still getting tons of backlash daily for everything that's going on Sophie on the other hand has been receiving a ton of love in all of this especially after she was seen going to dinner with Taylor Swift this past week people reacted to seeing both of Joe's exes hanging out saying Sophie Turner staying quiet and classy throughout this whole thing and then going out for margs with Taylor Swift dropping a lawsuit within 48 hours is the real Queen's Gambit Sophie Turner had one dinner with Taylor Swift and is ready to blow up Joe Jonas's life I love that so much for her people have also just been showing her love in general tweeting so Sophie Turner found out about the divorce via the media and Jonas is withholding the kids passports no wonder his media blitz what a piece of scum the messiness is about to begin so far it's just been sloppy with Joe's team saying so many things but now it looks like Sophie is gonna do this Queen of the North style Sophie is a queen God I wish nothing but the best for her in this whole situation I could never hate her she is Iconic obviously with anything there's been critics coming her way as well so she has faced some backlash but for the most part Joe has been the one that is receiving a ton of hate obviously you know he's a Jonas brother they are Jonas brother fans that are still gonna love Joe no matter what but a majority 30 of his comment section have been defending Sophie in all of this and as someone who loves Sophie Turner but also is the Jonas Brothers fan I really freaking hope that they can work this out peacefully civilly and quickly because it is just so messy at the moment and I just feel like a ton of fans love them both so much so to see this all play out is really sad there's kids involved here you never want a mess to be involved in a situation like this so as of right now that's what's been going on with these two let me know if you guys have been paying attention to what has been coming out about them all that has been playing out in court and the statements that have been made on both sides let me know your thoughts in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music] thank you [Music]
09/07/2023,Joe Jonas Is In Big Troouble (fans are upset),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQZPsZdfOvs,189-11, Joe Jonas is in some hot water after he filed for divorce Tuesday Morning this was after a weekend of rumors went around that him and Sophie Turner were on the rocks and it ended up being true that the two were separating but the reason why Joe is getting called out is because people feel like him and his team have been doing everything they can to make Sophie look bad in the current situation with each statement that's come out from sources close to him making her look like a bad mom or something and even Jonah's brother fans are disappointed in how she's being painted because some of the things being said about her can easily be proved as not true things were already a little strange on Joe's and before sources started talking to the Press because he hasn't been wearing his ring at the shows as of late and fans took notice of it then last week the rumors really started that Joe and Sophie were on the rocks and the two are extremely private rarely sharing their personal life lives including their children with the public some people didn't even note they had two daughters so to hear that they were on the rocks in any way people were just like what is going on especially since Sophie had just posted a photo of the two of them at a recent Jonas Brothers show as of just a few weeks ago August 14th she posted long long New York nights and it's the two of them she's kissing his hand everyone was like what do you mean they're on the Rocks people were then defending like oh you know not everyone wants to wear their wedding band I mean I know a ton of people that don't wear their wedding bands I was like I don't know if I believe this but over this past weekend as the rumors grew and grew Joe suddenly put his wedding ring on and a lot of people were thinking okay this is him shutting down the rumors he's saying we are together there's nothing going on everything is fine and fans thought the same fans at the show were thinking maybe it's a sign that everything being said was false and the couple still going strong but that didn't seem to be the case in the end the weird thing is that you know he did wear the ring and then the next day he posted on his Instagram also wearing the ring I mean it's front and center in this photo and then the next day on Tuesday Joe filed for divorce why he wore the ring I'm not sure it's an interesting move to say the least since the rumors weren't going to calm down with the news hitting public record that he filed and it's not like she filed and then he wore the ring to make it seem like he wanted to stay married or something like that he filed so him wearing the ring is just I don't know why he did that to shut the rumors down for like a day I am not sure maybe to wear it for one last time I'm not sure but when the documents came out they weren't making Sophie look good the document stated that the children had been residing with their father in Miami and other locations throughout the United States meaning that as he's been on tour he's had their kids and TMZ also reported that as for why Joe filed for divorce a source with direct knowledge tells us she likes to party he likes to stay at home they have very different Lifestyles which people haven't loved that Sophie is being painted in this way when there's been several times on camera that she's referred to herself as the homebody and Joe as the opposite on an episode of Conan during the pandemic she described herself as someone who likes to stay at home and Joe is a social butterfly that she struggles to keep down I mean I'm an introvert I'm an I'm a homebody I just like I I if I could stay at home all day I would Joe's like he's a real social butterfly so I struggle to kind of lock him down and in a tick tock that they filmed they both agreed that Sophie was the homebody in the relationship who's the homebody in the relationship like they both pointed to Sophie for that answer like they both willingly agree that she is the homebody so I don't really know where this she likes to party he likes to stay at home energy is coming from but it's not a cute look to be painting this about her when there's all this of her talking about staying at home it also frustrated fans that the documents and articles were making it seem like Sophie just up and left the kids with Joe to party or something but she's actually away working she's filming right now for an upcoming project so it's not like she decided that she didn't want to be a mom she's literally just been on set working in the UK but Joe and his team haven't stopped trying to make her look like the bad guy in the situation with the way every day it seems there's something new meant to make her look bad written in the Press coming from someone close to him TMZ wrote in an article on Wednesday that Joe Jonas saw slash heard something with Sophie Turner that was the last straw in his decision to file for divorce and it involves a ring camera multiple sources who have direct contact with Joe tell TMZ Joe had access to a ring camera that he said captured Sophie saying and or doing something that made him realize the marriage was over they didn't say what was heard but obviously people are going to start speculating after hearing something like this coming out about Sophie and of course right after this article comes out new photos surfaced just in time of course of Joe and his two daughters eating lunch together deal email posted them the photos were from back grid I believe but they said picture Joe Jonas ditch's wedding ring as he's seen for the first time with daughters after divorce filing from Sophie Turner amid claims he caught actress on ring security camera doing or saying something that was the last straw now I don't know if his team told him to get out there and look like dad of the Year taking the girls to lunch but it's not working out for him people know how private him and Sophie are and they rarely take their kids outside to be photographed and he knows this is a huge time for the press to be all eyes on him and Sophie so him taking the girls out to lunch he knows they're gonna be photographed and they're going to be photographed with him and of course that really feeds into this narrative that his team is really putting out there that you know Joe is there he's on tour he's taking care of the kids and Sophie is away like oh my gosh you guys the fans are not happy with how she's being painted in the media by his team and feeling like this whole daddy daughter lunch date was strategic and of course like him and Sophie have been out with the girls before but it's rare it is very rare because they don't show their kids faces they don't want them to be in the public eye and it really just feels like a purposeful attempt to make him look like he's this caring dad and she isn't there even though she's literally working and it's not like she's neglecting their children and okay obviously we don't know exactly what happened between them or what's going on but I'm just saying that fans don't like how it's getting messy and seemingly at the hands of Joe and his team but this same day that all of this was going on both Joe and Sophie did end up posting a joint statement to their Instagram account that read statement from the two of us after four wonderful years of marriage we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage there are many speculative narratives as to why but truly this is a United decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children people were very confused by this statement because the speculative narratives have been coming from Joe's team and the sources close to him which is exactly why there's been so much talk because people have been extremely disappointed in the statements that have been made on his behalf as some have continued to feel as though they're putting Sophie down Joe's Instagram comments are now filled with fans expressing how much they don't like what's been said saying the Sophie is a bad mom angle you're taking is not cool stop the smear campaign against Sophie it's disgusting and straight up vile the way your team is talking about the mother of your children just so you know we're all team Sophie so you can tell your PR team to stop throwing the mother of your children under the bus already something tells me you're the problem especially how fast your team is trying to make her look bad already not a good look for you I've been a lifelong Jonas Brothers fan but Sophie gets me in the divorce smearing Sophie is backfiring hard by the way my dude your PR team is on overdrive trying to make Sophie look bad it's not having the effect you think it's making just makes you look like a douche bullying a postpartum mom who dared to go back to work this whole thing has been such a mess and it's been sad to see how fans are feeling like they have to kind of pick sides with the way that everything has been painted in the Press I mean hopefully the messiness stops in people close to Joe can stop making these statements about Sophie to the Press because it's not helping Joe at all that is for sure even if it's close friends to him that are upset on his behalf and want to defend him or something right now just isn't the time for this but that's what's going on in this situation that has gotten Joe in some trouble and it's sad as the Jonas Brothers fan myself I don't want to see anyone in this family in drama and I like Sophie so it's just like sad that all this is happening but hopefully they can peacefully work things out I want to know if you guys have been seeing this go around what you guys think about the fact that fans feel the things being said or publicly making Sophie look bad let me know your thoughts I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music] thank you [Music] foreign
09/03/2023,Billie Eilish Ex Is A Real CREEP. Hereâ€™s Why..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUp5jGyH11s,192-11, y'all Billy eilish's creepy ex-boyfriend Jesse Rutherford is releasing a song that people believe is about her and the lyrics are absolutely insane yeah I do it's really cool and I'm really excited and I'm really happy about it I managed to get my way to a point in my life my life to a point where I Not only was known by a person that I thought was the hottest [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] alive but pulled his ass are you kidding me can we just Round of Applause for me Jesse Rutherford everyone I pulled his ass all me I did that [Â __Â ] I locked that [Â __Â ] don't first of all Billy's fans have never liked Jesse and always felt that their relationship was kind of creepy especially because of the huge age gap between them Jessie is literally more than 10 years older than Billy but that's just the tip of the iceberg y'all people have also pointed out the fact that Billy said Jessie was his childhood musical Muse and that he really looked up to him as a matter of fact Billy explicitly said she started listening to him when she was 13. when they went Instagram official with their relationship in August of 2022 the news didn't sit well with her fans however Billy was so head over heels in love with Jesse that it's safe to say that she treated other people's opinions concerning their relationship as noise like the age thing never bothered her but the critics went on and on which got people wondering whether these concerns ever got to them until they made it clear that they didn't care you all remember their controversial 2022 Halloween outfits where Billy dressed as a child and Jesse went as an old man fortunately for Billy's fans their relationship lasted as short as a New Year's resolution to go to the gym and they split after only being together for seven months at the time they said that they had ended things amicably but did they because going by the lyrics of Jessie's new song there is no way these two are on good terms in fact dare I say Jesse never liked Billy at all okay lobs without further Ado let's dig into these disturbing lyrics that have had people losing their minds Jesse starts out by saying I'm at the top you're at the bottom it's a different point of view calling out and one every time I point and shoot okay first of all y'all it takes a great deal of delusion for Jesse to even attempt to compare his musical accomplishments to those of Billy eilish Jessie is a member of the neighborhood band and they've done pretty well for themselves because if you scroll through their YouTube channel alone their viewership is not so bad yet Jesse must be consuming something so strong to have convinced himself that their Collective effort as a band of five is anything close to what Billy eilish has achieved single-handedly seriously you don't need to be a math wizard to see the massive gap between these two channels Bailey is almost hitting 50 million subscribers when the neighborhood is still chilling at a Solid 5 million and they're likely to be stagnant there for a hot minute Billy eilish's Musical RS oh come on it's like questioning if ice cream is cold all her songs are a massive success hitting an all-time high we're talking about over 800 million views 600 million views 300 million views her total YouTube viewership stands at 14 billion views guys that's almost double the human population so the level of audacity that Jesse Rutherford had when he wrote I'm at the top you're at the bottom it's a different point of view is something that should be studied as a topic on Fantasyland Institute if with her whopping 14 billion views Billy is at the bottom then Jesse is on a tour at Earth's center for the confused you would think that Jesse would stop there right huh this is what he wrote next calling out and one every time I point and shoot I point and shoot on the clock non-stop I keep winning I can't lose well well well if anyone happens to be with an Arm's Reach of Jesse Rutherford could you do Humanity a favor and give him a not so gentle shake back to reality because the Dude is too far gone why is he trying so hard to channel his inner Eminem when he's the guy who's in a band singing about sweater weather this one has wandered off the map every time I point and shoot on the clock non-stop I keep winning sir the only thing you've won is a gold medal in wishful thinking please sit down take several seats Jesse if songwriting is your hidden talent then it better stay hidden guys if you thought that was it buckle up because it gets worse this is the part that has gotten people firing at him he goes on to say the creepiest thing feeling like Alejandro when she Gaga on my goo y'all this is so unacceptable we can't move past this because guys this is a whole 31 year old man writing some rather mature lyrics about someone he dated who is more than 10 years younger and he has the nerve to say Gaga on my goo just when we thought the creepiest songwriter of the Year award was firmly in Colleen Ballinger's grip Jesse Rutherford said hold my beer I need you guys to Picture This Jesse is probably chilling in his creative corner somewhere Serene and quiet maybe sipping some herbal tea and even meditating then lo and behold this is what he came up with his Masterpiece of all time do you know why this gets weirder Billy in her 2022 Vanity Fair interview shared that her love language was physical touch and that alone makes these lyrics even more problematic my whatever they say love language is just physical touch I just need to be touching skin all the time touching and cuddling and hugging and and anything skin related is really a big thing for me and and other than that just like Freedom you know I don't want to be controlled this takes us back to the main reason why people cringed at the huge age gap between them I mean seriously this isn't exactly the line you can proudly shout from the rooftops when you've been cozying up with someone who's barely out of high school let me tell you fans did not hold back they went full on Chef mode and fried him up straight to a crisp this is disturbing who in their right mind would ever think this is okay literally what the [Â __Â ] are these lyrics When She's Gaga on my goo Jessie Rutherford is so disgusting definitely thought he ate that I wrote better bars in Middle School Hold On Tight loves because we're not in the clear just yet right after that unsettling gaga goo serenade Jesse has more audacity to remind us that she's been listening to him since 2013. well well well it's as clear as day that he's dropping some hints about none other than Billy eilish because she has said over and over that Jesse was like a small God to her and that she listened to his music since she was practically knee-high I managed to get my way to a point in my life my life to a point where I Not only was no known by a person that I thought was the hottest [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] alive but pulled his ass are we kidding me in 2013 Billy eilish was a 12 year old girl while Jesse was 22. and you'd think he was wise enough to walk carefully around that topic but no Jesse literally feels he deserves bragging rights for getting physical with someone who even as of now is younger than he was in 2013. this is how criminals leave clues that make it easy for police to catch them so by this point Jesse has attacked Billy's career and personality and if he had even an ounce of decency left in him he'd probably stop there but no that's not Jesse's style he still had one more card under his sleeve and you'd better believe he pulled it the bar reads I know she's got Daddy Issues welcome to the family so this is probably something Billy eilish confided in him about which is a delicate matter something that even a random Joe on the street might offer a little sympathy for but Jesse made it a song instead because you know why not share his ex's private Matters To The World guys I'm genuinely curious at what age does one fully develop emotional intelligence speaking of emotional maturity Jesse and his disgusting supporters saying they started dating when she was legally fine should just shut up because any adult hooping around with a minor waiting for them to hit the legal age of consent to start dating them is a pedophile listen up everyone this is the unfiltered truth those smooth talking groomers have a way of making you feel special while also dangling the fact that being with them is a privilege they are handing you and they are absolute pros at keeping that illusion swirling over your head that is exactly what Jesse Rutherford pulled on Billy eilish and how do I know this the proof is in his lyrics She said Jessie baby won't you write a song about me I said I got a whole album I could drop next week what doesn't kill you makes you stronger Jesse made Little Billy thinks she was privileged to be with someone who listened to her personal struggles and would even drop an entire problem about her she even confirmed it herself I want to be trusted and I want to be able to have space and I want love and and attention and equal admiration is really important I just I'm really inspired by this person and he he's inspired by me it's really cool poor Billy literally believed they inspired each other guys Jesse is back to delusion land shorty come with me watch your money get longer boy go home what money why is it that the worst performers are always the loudest was Jesse intimidated by Billy's level of success because even a cat napping in the sun knows that Billy eilish is the one with the most Financial Muscle between the two dear Jesse here's a little reality check Billy eilish doesn't need to come with you to watch her money grow longer you on the other hand need all the coins you can get because you need it now look at him self-proclaimed Lyricist turn into an All-Star in a pair of Converse blew up by myself I feel like the Unabomber I'm sure even Converse must be itching to dial their lawyers after being unwillingly roped into this catastrophe because I ain't never been this high but I'm not trying to come down no Jesse you're right about being high but you definitely must come down y'all this song is a complete disaster we've definitely seen worse I mean Hello Colleen queen of ukulele but the main issue with Jesse's Song is how he's specifically targeted Billy eilish particularly at a time when she was a minor the saddest part of all of this is just how Billy eilish bless her still talks positively of him and even considers him a close friend Billy even recently said during a q a on her Instagram that they are no longer dating but are really good friends but are they consider this a reminder that a man can wake up even in the middle of the night just to embarrass you and then go back to sleep some people took it upon themselves to warn teenagers against dating older people and since some of you are my subscribers I thought it was to share some of the comments with you he pulled his ass no girl he pulled you and made you think it was all your idea to the team that gets told he's dating her because she's mature no sweetheart he's dating you because you're impressionable and women his age see through his [Â __Â ] so he can't get someone his age right now the anticipation for Billy eilish's 2023 Vanity Fair interview is practically buzzing in the air you see last year she was super proud of herself and had a self-congratulatory moment for successfully locking down Jesse Rutherford you all know that Vanity Fair has this neat trick where they replay your past interviews and prompt your reactions which will be a cocktail of fun and disaster for Billy eilish especially now that her romantic affair with Jesse Rutherford has hit the rocks and now there is this song I know a lot of people can't wait to see her reacting to the part where she is drooling over Jessie who in her opinion is the hottest guy in the universe this guy yeah I do it's really cool and I'm really excited and I'm really happy about it I managed to get my way to a point in my life my life to a point where I Not only was known by a person that I thought was the hottest [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] alive but pulled his ass are you kidding me can we just Round of Applause for me thank you Jesse run the hood everyone I pulled his ass all me I did that [Â __Â ] I locked that [Â __Â ] down some fans are always a lot more direct with their sentiments like these it's so sad how so many young female artists get into relationships with older men who treat them horribly you give an ugly guy a chance he thinks he rules the world Billy oh honey if you ever find yourself cringing at this Prime clown moment in your life don't fret too much it happens to the best of us anyways loves I would love to hear your opinion on this situation down below also don't

08/17/2023,Doja Cat NEEDS Help..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbHhWbomXbg,183-11,dojika is doubling down on her recent comments about her fans she's saying that 500 000 fans on following her feels like defeating a large Beast to her for those of you who haven't been caught up with Doja cat over this past month she has been doubling down on her recent comments about her fans and she's been getting a ton of backlash for it her recent Behavior has led her fans to start unfollowing her as well as deleting their pages that have been dedicated to supporting her now Doja is someone who has always been pretty vocal about her unease when it comes to the music industry but in recent months she's decided to clap at her fans for no apparent reason she's been completely unhinged going after her fan base and even slamming her stance for calling themselves kittens a name that she herself suggested for her fandom and now doja's audience finally seems to be done putting up with her behavior and they're pretty fed up with her Doja cat just continues to be a truly unlikable person I honestly think that's the only way to describe it she's on threads getting into it with her fans right now saying my life my rules my style my attitude and one of the fan accounts says I really want to hear you say that you love and appreciate us Dojo says I don't though because I don't even know y'all which yeah you don't know them personally and I think that it's okay to establish a boundary with your fan base but saying that straight up I think is just nasty spirited and to straight up say that to someone who has supported you and supported your craft and literally funded your entire Lifestyle by supporting you just seems mean this comment then goes on to say and we don't know you personally but we have supported you you'd be nothing without us you'd be working at a grocery store which is kind of funny in a garage band miss high school dropout so they kind of gagged her back which was deserved and she says nobody forced you I don't know where talking to me like you're my mother you sound like a crazy person you can't make your living off of people being obsessed with you and then call them crazy and weird for being obsessed with you she's just being straight up mean to people now and if her fans continue to support her more power to them but I did see a lot of people asking for refunds for her tour and they're selling their tickets so I'm sure she'll start to care when she walks into an empty Arena and if it starts affecting our pockets as a result of the way she was speaking towards her fans just last month she has lost about 500 000 followers just to give you guys some context on how severe and unhinged the things that Dojo was saying to her fans over on social media last month just super uncalled replies she was giving some of the things she would say were if you call yourself a kitten or effing kittens that means you need to get off your phone and get a job and help your parents with the house also as a part of the controversy she got into last month Doja upset plenty of her fans by refusing to say that she loved them she responded to one fan saying I don't know because I don't even know y'all she also hit back at a fan who asked what they should change the fan name to instead responding just delete the account and rethink everything it's never too late unfortunately and as sad as the sounds this actually led a lot of Doja cat fan accounts to end up deleting their pages because they were pretty hurt with the way someone they've really been looking up to was responding to them and this is what Doja had to say just as of yesterday in response to losing thousands of followers as a result of her blunt rude Behavior let me just warn you it doesn't get better and she's blatantly being rude and arrogant to her fans who actually cared about her again she posted this over on her Instagram stories yesterday saying seeing all these people unfollow makes me feel like I've defeated a large beast that's been holding me down for so long and it feels like I can reconnect with the people who really matter and love me for who I am and not for who I was I feel free that same day Doja also came out with an interview with Harper's Bazaar where she talked a little bit more about her personal life some projects she's working on for the future as well as you guessed it her fans let's go over some of the things she was asked as well as her response is towards the beginning she was asked about her recent style change and she was asked by the interviewer you definitely push boundaries why do you think people go crazy when you do things like shave your head or eyebrows to which Dojo responded saying my theory is that if someone has never met me in real life then subconsciously I'm not real to them so when people become engaged with someone they don't even know on the internet they kind of take ownership over that person they think that person belongs to them in some sense and when that person change drastically there is a shock response that is almost uncontrollable I've accepted that that's what happened so I put my wigs on and take them off I shave my head or my eyebrows I have all the freedom in the world now I do think there's some truth to what Doja is saying in her response here but I think that what a lot of people can agree on was the way exactly she had responded to her fans she could have definitely been less harsh and the approach was just not it she said I put myself out there on social media media and TV but I don't really put myself out there in real life she was asked what do you imagine is next for you Doja said there are other kinds of projects I want to Branch out into Doja hasn't been shy from expressing that music isn't really something that she is all that into as much she said there are other kind of projects I want to Branch out into I want to make clothing dabble and makeup I want to explore acting then she was asked about her potential acting career do you envision acting becoming a big part of your career I would love to do movies that I believe in I would have to stop the music for a minute but I would be down to immerse myself in acting for a certain period of time I love comedies and action films I want to learn martial arts and be in a film like John Wick she also dabbled in and talked a little about respect and earning respect as a very popular musician the interviewer said an icon by definition is a person or a thing regarded as a representative symbol or as worthy of veneration do you see yourself as worthy of veneration Dojo responded saying I don't I think I deserve love and respect from the people that I love and respect back and I guess respect means different things to some people I put myself out there on social media and TV I shoot my image out on these screens but I don't really put myself out there in real life I don't go to clubs I stick to creating but she did speak a bit highly about her fans specifically sticking up for her when it comes to certain situations in this part of the interview do you get inspiration from other people and their energy she said I love positive feedback I appreciate when people speak up for someone who is getting bullied or attacked by internet trolls some of the most moving moments for me have been when my fans have stood up for me or for other people that's fighting for something real I really appreciate it because people like to sh talk anyways guys this has been doja's response to losing hundreds of thousands of followers as a result of the way she was publicly acting on social media and the way she was treating her fans I definitely want to know what you guys think in the comments down below do you think she's gotten even more unhinged and what do you think overall about her response definitely let me know in the comments down below I love you guys so much and as always I'll see y'all in the next video foreign 
08/10/2023,This TikToker Just EXPOSED Ariana For Being A HOME WRECKER..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0pQWNf0yk0,181-11, y'all thought you knew all about Ariana Grande's Tangled love life well think again because we've gotten yet another bombshell to draw for those who don't know Ariana has been called out like never before and things just keep going from bad to worse for her as you all already know her current situationship with Ethan Slater isn't just another heartbreak Story the truth behind it involves stolen hearts and broken trust that'll make you wonder what she's really up to if you live under a rock and don't know what I'm talking about let me fill you in real quick Everyone Knows by now that Ariana Grande and her co-star Ethan Slater are having a fling only that this isn't your typical Hollywood fling this is a story of passion betrayal and secrets that were locked away tighter than your iPhone password most people are pretty upset because Ethan and her now estranged wife Lily J just had a baby and this news must be very difficult for her to process at this time I did not know that she had so many victims and when I found that out that really irked me and to also come in between a marriage with a baby something needs to be said because she clearly doesn't get it if she's been doing this for this long so while we all hoped this was just for clout bam pictures are Songbird and Ethan we're getting cozy long before the world knew their names were intertwined and let's not forget Don Gomez her hubby of two years is now in the rear view mirror but that is not why we are here loves not at all this affair has thrown the spotlight on Ariana's complicated web of relationships which to our shock started a while ago guys I'm talking about as early as 2009. turns out sliding into other people's relationships is her hobby way back when she was just starting out people were already talking about her messy relationships it's like she had a plan for causing drama and breaking hearts right from the beginning her current affair with Ethan Slater has triggered more and more people who have come out with their Tales of nasty encounters with Ariana all all regarding infidelity I know y'all have seen all that but unfortunately for Ariana she must have hurt way too many people and this is their moment to come out trust me you don't want to miss this it all started with this tick tocker who goes by the name Ricky Valentina who posted this video accompanied with the caption when Karma finally exposes Ariana Grande after she stole your boyfriend in 2009. she went ahead and wrote I've been waiting to share this tea and y'all her timing was perfect her video got millions of views in no time so once she got enough people curious she served us a very detailed story time so this tick tocker narrated how she also fell victim to Ariana Grande's home wrecking stints she said that this happened in 2010 when Ariana was still in a relationship with graham Phillips this Tick Tock video now has over 5 million views Ricky Valentina said that she has since moved on and is even married but felt the need to narrate her own Saga now that Ariana was now hurting married women too of course she was referring to Ethan partner and if you're thinking wait isn't this Scandal over a decade old well you're not wrong Ariana's been stirring up drama since before emojis were a thing some people judged her caption telling her that it's impossible for Ariana to actually steal a whole person and that he shares equal blame she acknowledged all that but she kept saying Ariana was at fault too because she knew what she was doing Ricky revealed that back in 2010 Ariana snatched Christian Fortune who is also an actor from her so her then boyfriend and Ariana met on the set of sitcom Victorious the two hit it off right away and Ricky says that at first everything was okay until their communication became too frequent and too intimate for casual friends after a while there were still aiming each other and I got to the point where I was like okay so I asked him hey what are you guys talking about like it's a little weird she went on to say that since she was still young she couldn't tell what Ariana's real intentions were but she seems to be pretty persistent in a way that suggested she was trying to impress Christian fortune in a separate video Ricky talks about her suspicions getting the better of her to the point that she decided to check out his Facebook and she had earlier mentioned that Christian used to be such a controlling partner that he required her to give him all his social media passwords he was very manipulative in this relationship because he would be very quiet about me and I never saw that this was my first boyfriend ever you know I don't I don't think these things and he also would ask for my passwords for all my social media like oh you have to give me your password for Facebook Myspace Twitter all that fun stuff so I was like oh okay so then you have to give me your password this gesture would later lead her to closure because she also asked Christian Fortune for his passwords When Love Was still in the air and he agreed so as Ariana and Christian's Bond grew Tighter and Tighter Ricky became certain that there was more to it and so she accessed his Facebook and guys her heart dropped into her stomachs her suspicions were confirmed Ariana and Christian had taken their relationship to the next level the two were already meeting up behind her back and sometimes chilling in her dressing room on set she says it got to a point where the two weren't even hiding it anymore as they were leaving smiley faces on each other's walls this is so messy because Ricky and Ariana were also friends on Facebook Christian eventually broke up with Ricky soon after missing her homecoming the reason for the breakup you asked his reason was like a bad sitcom line okay you know what I think I'm holding you back yep you heard that right it's like he auditioned for a Cheesy breakup scene straight out of his soap opera so of course we all know there's more to the story anyways loves Ricky didn't just give up there she narrates how she gathered courage and sent Ariana a long message to let her know that Christian Fortune was too timing them she still wanted to give Ariana the benefit of the doubt that she wasn't aware Christian was in a relationship so she sent the message and also included proof and waited for a response and then waited for a little more and guys Ariana never wrote back she blocked Ricky so I sent her this long message like hey girl like I don't know if you know this but I was dating Christian while you guys were getting together and he was also like with me while he was with you you know looking out for each other that's what girl code is what does she do she blocks me she blocks me on Facebook by this time Ricky only had one card up her sleeve since she still had Christian's Facebook password she logged in and used it to message Ariana one more time it didn't take long before Christian rise that Ricky was using his account to message Ariana so he kicked her out too maybe these are some of the reasons why Ricky strongly holds Ariana accountable to date because it seemed like she knew what she was doing from the onset he definitely wasn't full more so at fault than her but she also knew what she was doing so she is at fault also the only reason I am bringing this up because I am over it is because I did not know that she had so many victims Christian and Ariana still had their thing going on for a while and by this time they weren't afraid to show it guys they even had matching Facebook profile pictures and Ricky says she made one similar to theirs just to piss them off this was her profile picture this was his profile picture and this was my profile picture fortunately for Ricky this event had a happy ending she ended the video by saying that she's actually grateful that Ariana snatched Christian because she met someone more amazing who is now her husband but that wasn't all Ricky is also a musician and actress so she made a song about her cheating boyfriend which gained over 28 000 plays and yeah that's a win for an independent writer I also made a song about his cheating ass which has 28 000 plays which is pretty good for an independent artist so that's a win for me too of course Ariana and Christian's sneaky Love Story didn't last and guess who cheated and left you got it right once the fun part was over Ariana got bored so she moved on to her next exciting Adventure which must have been someone else's man I told y'all it's her hobby Christian on the other hand went back to Ricky to beg for a second chance but access was denied and here's the real kicker I guess she ended up cheating on him so he came crawling back to me and apologized and I said bye I don't know about the rest of y'all but most people are saying that Ariana is giving the ultimate homewrecker Vibes thanks love so watching and let me know what you think about Ariana's character down below also click this link if you missed out on what Ariana said concerning her now ex-husband Dalton Gomez
08/02/2023,Lizzo Is In Big Trouble (major lawsuit),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmrAmmhjOaI,178-11, this is certainly not a title of a video I thought I would be posting that's for sure I thought lizzo was quite unproblematic but that's clearly not the case right now as she's being sued along with her dance Captain Shirlene Quigley three of her former dancers have accused lizzo and Charlene of a number of things as described in their lawsuit against them the civil lawsuit was filed yesterday in Los Angeles County's Superior Court making numerous charges against each of them Ariana Davis Crystal Williams and Noel Rodriguez are the ones suing Ariana and Crystal begin performing with lizzo after competing on her Amazon reality show watch out for the big girls in 2021 and Noel was hired after performing in lizzo's video rumors this news shocks social media users as they learn the lawsuit given that lizzo has seemingly always championed body positivity and these claims were saying otherwise amongst a bunch of other things that were very disturbing to hear about that lizzo had participated in allegedly allegedly allegedly but we're gonna get into what is being said by the three former dancers in regards to lizzo specifically the lawsuit detailed a night out in Amsterdam in February where the dancers and lizzo visited a club where lizzo allegedly pressured them to touch the nude performers that were there it was a nude club and allegedly she had not told them this information ahead of time and the lawsuit detailed some other disturbing things that occurred while they were at this club like catching certain objects that were coming out of performers and eating bananas that were also coming out of the performers the lawsuit also alleged that this same night lizzo had allegedly quote battered the security guard to get on the club's stage until he submitted to her demands and according to variety the complaint continues plaintiffs were angst with how little regardless showed for the bodily autonomy of her employees and those around her especially in the presence of many people whom she employed lizzo was also accused of having formerly weight shamed a dancer Ariana Davis detailed a time where she was questioned as to why she seemed less bubbly and vivacious than she did prior to the tour starting variety wrote that the complaint stated in professional dance a dancer's weight gain is often seen as the dancer getting lazy or worse off as a performer lizzo and choreographer Tanisha Scott's questions about Miss Davis's commitment to the tour were thinly veiled concerns about Miss Davis's weight gain which lizzo had previously called attention to after noticing it at the South by Southwest Music Festival the lawsuit States although lizzo and Miss God never explicitly stated it the questions accompanied by lizzo's statements made out through the South by Southwest Music Festival gave Miss Davis the impression that she needed to explain her weight gain and disclose intimate personal details about her life in order to keep her job in regards to Charlene she was accused of allegedly pushing her Christian beliefs onto the dancers shaming them if they did not share the same beliefs as her especially when it came to waiting for marriage allegedly the lawsuit also touched on the fact that she had allegedly learned that Ariana was a virgin and Shirlene would apparently routinely discuss the subject and had brought it up in interviews and on social media and apparently she had also detailed her own personal life with her own husband and what they do in the bedroom and things like that to the dancers which that whole thing that is so strange like what are you doing talking about that type of stuff allegedly orianna ended up getting fired for recording a meeting where lizzo had given out notes to dancers about their performances Crystal stated that she was fired due to budget cuts but the lawsuit points out that no one else was fired that day Crystal also noted that she had spoken up at a meeting in which lizzo had accused the dancers of drinking before performances and it led to a back and forth between them as she was challenging lizzo during this conversation and the way it's kind of written is making it seem like she feels like that's why she was allegedly maybe possibly fired but they said that it was due to budget cuts and apparently just the day before this back and forth with lizzo happened between Crystal and her lizzo had told the dancers that they would have to audition again according to the lawsuit this led to an excruciating 12-hour rehearsal in which Ariana before she was fired ended up soiling her pants because she was too fearful of losing her job to use the bathroom so that's the kind of environment that we're getting described here is one where you can't even use the bathroom without feeling like her job is at risk now like I said both girls ended up getting fired how however Noel resigned from her role in solidarity with Ariana and Crystal getting fired and according to the guardian when Rodriguez brought up the firings of Williams and Davis she claimed she was dismissed as we've never had a problem with you the suit claims that Rodriguez as one of the few members of the dance cast who is not black was not painted with the same generalized and unfounded criticisms as the black members of the dance cast The Dancer's attorney provided a statement to Entertainment Weekly that read the stunning nature of how lizzo and her management team treated their performers seems to go against everything lizzo stands for publicly while privately she weight shames her dancers and demeans them in ways that are not only illegal but absolutely demoralizing lizzo's former creative director along with one of her former dancers posted on social media sharing support for the lawsuit filed against her one of them posting for clarification I'm not part of the lawsuit but but this was very much my experience in my time there big shout out to the dancers who had the courage to bring this to light she was met with support with somebody else posting her story saying echoing what at Seaquest said I haven't been a part of that world for around three years for a reason I very much applaud the dancers courage to bring this to light and I grieve parts of my own experience I'd appreciate space to understand my feelings another former employee shared on Twitter sharing this because validating other black women's experiences is deeply important to me and she said I usually do not comment on anything pop culture related but in 2019 I traveled a bit with lizzo to be the director of her documentary I walked away after about two weeks I was treated with such disrespect by her I witnessed how arrogant self-centered and unkind she is I was not protected and was thrown into a situation with little support my spirit said to run as fast as you effing can and I'm so grateful I trusted my gut I felt gaslit and was deeply hurt but I have healed reading these reports made me realize how dangerous of a situation it was this kind of abusive power happens far too often much love and support to the dancers the internet like I said has been in a State of Shock over this news coming out with people saying I really try not to idolize celebrities because anyone can be a horrible person but lizzo really has knocked the wind out of me as someone who has gone out of her way to be perceived as a safe space and an advocate for all people it's insane how two-faced someone can be it's curtains for lizzo and the situation keeps getting worse as more info unfolds her whole brand was about body positivity yet she wasn't practicing what she was preaching being a bully to these women hoping the victims get Justice that lizzo article kept getting bad as you kept reading it I was shocked this lizzo news ruined my day not gonna lie I don't really idolize people but seeing someone who looked like me and came from a similar background reaching high levels of success was so inspiring and just amazing to watch so many hearts breaking a little bit hearing all of this Shirlene did end up posting on her Instagram once all of this news was made public and this is what she had to say on Instagram hey everybody I just want to get on here really quick and say God is so so good God loves you so so so so so so so so much no matter what you're going through even if you don't love him he loves you glory to God I just want to remind you that he is love he is truth he is the light he is the first and the last and all things work together for those that are called according to his purpose and I just feel so blessed I feel so thankful I feel so full of joy I had such an amazing time on tour with amazing people and I'm so excited to be home resting with my family and my dog after an amazing experience and yeah I just wanted to like tell everyone that God loves you and I love you and Lord's God and I hope you're smiling and you feel Joy no matter where you're at or what you're going through because I'm telling you God loves you bye that's what she had to say some people have some thoughts on what she had to say given what is said in the lawsuit but that is what she had come out and said once all this was made public I guess we'll have to see how the story unfolds from here let me know what you guys think about all of this in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music] thank you [Music]
07/22/2023,Ariana Grande Opens Up About Divorce With Dalton Gomez..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyJz0XOhXSQ,174-11, y'all Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez are getting a divorce it's real and it's happening and you won't believe the audacity of this man and what he put Ariana through it's not even that long ago that I was talking about how there's definitely something going on in their relationship but I can't lie I wasn't actually expecting a divorce from them so soon rumors of Dalton cheating on Ariana have been floating around for months now and they've had some serious issues with trying to see each other because Ariana was too busy filming Wicked in the UK and Dalton was busy with his work which is apparently touring houses a uh he's been way too busy to visit Ariana and the distance was super hard for them sources even said the movie has completely taken over her life Ariana has been in Australia and England for almost a year and she still has months to go her marriage has definitely taken a back seat and it's been a huge strain Dalton was apparently so done with the whole thing and these sources have also said that Dalton is used to her career being a priority his patience has worn thin he just wants his partner back I think it's safe to say that he was not happy with this whole Wicked thing but honestly he married a celebrity so I really don't know what he was expecting it's true that Ariana was extremely busy with the musical since she was literally putting her everything into it and had gone all out with acting lessons and the vocal training she was actually so dedicated that she even chose to spare her voice for filming so she couldn't even talk on the phone with Dalton for long I understand that must have been kind of horrible but guys texting still exists so there's no way they weren't communicating at all and from a distance they still seem to be pretty much in love even just last month they were still acting like they were in a honeymoon phase their second wedding anniversary had also just passed and judging from Ariana's post about it they were still very much in love but when Ariana started appearing in public without her wedding ring fans started to suspect that their relationship might not be as happy as it seems she showed up to Wimbledon which is a soup for a fancy sporting event and was around all these celebrities dressed to the nines yet had no diamond on her finger and it really did look incredibly suspicious and y'all as I've said it looks like Dalton was doing some sketchy things behind Ariana's back celebrity gossip site dumwa actually revealed some juicy rumors about Dalton months ago and I'm starting to believe that they were 100 true this A-list singer has asked her husband multiple times to fly overseas to see her but each and every time he has said no because he is far too busy with work uh-huh still has time to go to the clubs and meet other women from online someone even posted a video of Dalton out at a bar where it looks like Dalton took his ring off back in February it's safe to say that fans were pissed seeing this video who does Dalton think he is taking off his ring that symbolizes his marriage to the Ariana Grande it will always be F Dalton Gomez she deserves so much better so Dalton has apparently been cheating on Ariana for months behind her back and people of course refused to believe it but now that the divorce has been confirmed it was actually also confirmed that Dalton has in fact been dating other women for some time now y'all this is so shocking to me because Ari was definitely showing no signs of any of this going on in her relationship and I'm honestly not even sure if she knew about it there's also another super blind item from this month actually that suggested that the two were spending time together and that Dalton wanted to keep Ariana all to himself while the Barbie Premiere was going on this A-list singer who is turning back into an actress wanted to attend the premiere of this long-awaited movie but her significant other told her she should stay home with him because he didn't want to go and it would be bad if she went without him Dalton and Ariana got together while kovid was going on so he wasn't really exposed to her celebrity lifestyle that much at that time and when things did open up again Ariana went straight to England for Wicked so Dalton has pretty much no exposure to her celebrity lifestyle but stopping her from attending the biggest movie premiere of the year is just too far Dalton being shielded from Ariana's Celebrity Status at the start was honestly what completely doomed this relationship since he had no idea what he was actually getting into and people have been pointing out the biggest reason for this divorce is just that he couldn't take the pressure so it's covet's beginning of 2020 they're like oh you you're hot I love you whatever and then lockdown so then for a year they're just cocooned in this love Bubble in her house real life doesn't come up at all and then they get married the world opens up and suddenly he's like wait a minute you're Ariana Grande you want to photograph you all time you have to move around with security you have millions of fans waiting for you people care about you so much he didn't want that life he was actually a rare Normie he who was unthirsty he did not want a part of that Spotlight and when it comes to something like a movie premiere Ariana is a huge celebrity and people probably wouldn't have even noticed if she showed up without him so this just seems extremely unnecessary to me and I honestly could see this as the reason why Ariana decided enough was enough and filed for divorce it also sounds like Ariana was trying her best to juggle both this relationship and her career and that she tried to get Dalton to fly over and visit her multiple times but he was the one who couldn't take time off from his real estate job to visit her it's really strange that Ariana could apparently find time in her schedule to have Dalton over but his job couldn't allow him a few days off and it's just starting to sound like he was making excuses so he could keep seeing other women in the states honestly guys Dalton seems to have had wandering eyes for a while now since back in 2021 there was a rumor going around that Ariana saw Dalton with another woman at a party and it completely broke her so if he could do that while she was right there then what has he actually been up to while she is away filming Dalton actually got a lot of hate this year for doing all this to Ariana since fans refused to Stand By and Watch and he never actually addressed any of it and instead just deleted his Instagram this was so sketchy since it seemed like he had nothing to say for himself and took the Cowardly way out but now that the divorce has been officially confirmed to happen we've gotten a lot more insight into what was really going on between them behind the scenes insiders said that this was a mutual decision and that they've actually been having problems since before January and want to remain friends some people actually think that this might mean that they've been separated since January and that Dalton seeing other women was fair game but nothing has actually been confirmed about it it has also been revealed that Dalton actually flew to London to try and work things out with Ariana back in January but it didn't really fix anything and they've been Rocky ever since it sounds like they pretty much knew their relationship was doomed at that point but some fans are still very skeptical about the timeline of things this article saying that they are separated since January but Ariana celebrated the anniversary this year and Dalton got her name tattooed on his chest like weeks ago they need to be for real they also attached this clip of Ari saying that she's definitely not getting a divorce from just last year same I'm just not wearing my ring it's getting cleaned I'm not getting a divorce before you start don't however sources are being very open about the fact that their relationship just didn't work and that the divorce is definitely happening Ariana and Dalton couldn't make their marriage work in a post-coveted world because their lives were so vastly different Dalton was taken aback by Ariana's celebrity we're told Dalton sometimes questioned why they needed to go around town with security something that was a must for Ariana apparently they gave it another shot in May But ultimately it had to give the whole thing up because Dalton just wasn't prepared for this kind of Lifestyle however some fans don't buy the fact that Dalton had no idea what he was getting into and called him out for it they go after the famous woman and then once they've chased her down and they've got her and she's in love with him they do this thing I call playing dumb where they go oh I didn't know you were famous oh I didn't know a bunch of guys liked your Instagram pictures oh you didn't cause you found her on Instagram by dming her so you didn't know guys liked your pictures huh and it looks like Ariana might have realized how bad this relationship actually was for her because guys she liked some shocking posts on Instagram she seems to have found this account posting about difficult relationships and she liked some saying never again will I be in a relationship with someone I fear and some fans have even pointed out that her lyrics from 6 30 could definitely be a call out especially lines like axo possessive and crazy and you ain't scared to show me you're ugly well at the time these things seemed romantic they definitely screamed toxic masculinity now guys even their friends have come out to say that they were concerned for the relationship from the beginning are Ariana and Dalton's friends have always been concerned by their Whirlwind romance and felt their relationship would ultimately be short-lived at this point it sounds like they stood no chance from the start as their lives are just too different and this was definitely a too hasty decision anyways guys what are your feelings on this divorce let me know down below and don't forget to check out this other video for more drama
07/21/2023,Ariana Grande DIVORCED & DATING Her Co-Star?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cpMQMx5Ao,173-11, Ariana Grande is reportedly moving on after her split split into B ex-husband Dalton Gomez and it seems like she's moving on with one of her co-stars named Ethan Slater who she's been working with on this set of their upcoming show called wicked Ethan has since gone private over on his Instagram page ever since reports started coming out about his alleged romance with Ariana and people are just like that's really telling both Ariana and Ethan have reportedly left their marriage not too long ago and a lot of people have differing opinions about this first let's go over the article that came out just a couple of days ago about Ariana Grande and her divorce with her soon-to-be ex-husband Dalton Gomez for context Dalton has removed his page from Instagram if you look him up you won't be able to find his page and Ariana has also deleted a bunch of her photos with Dalton over on her Instagram as well as her wedding photos which says a lot people have also been noticing that she deleted a bunch of her highlights from her Instagram page that featured Dalton so there's definitely something that has been going on between them a few days ago TMZ reported Ariana Grande Dalton Gomez separated heading for divorce A source told them Ariana Grande and her husband Dalton Gomez have been separated since January and they are heading toward divorce and to add on to that people also noticed that Ariana wasn't seen with her wedding ring in her recent appearance at Wimbledon that definitely shocked a lot of people the article continues saying as we reported Ariana was not wearing her wedding ring at Wimbledon over the weekend in fact she has been ringless a lot these days we're told a few months back the two tried a reconciliation but it failed One Source with direct knowledge told TMZ through a relationship is a heading for divorce now I could actually see why this could be the case Ariana has been spending most of this year filming for her show Wicked and that what's been taking a huge part of her life she's been out of town filming and Dalton is just living in California where he's from probably just living a more normal life as he is a real estate agent living in California the two also did meet during the time of the pandemic which Looking Back Now a lot of people could see why the relationship wasn't going to last throwback to Holiday actually met during the pandemic lockdown Ariana started to look for a new home in Los Angeles as a real estate agent Dalton Gomez happened to show the singer a few Los Angeles area homes when she saw him she immediately thought he was cute and very good looking A source told US Weekly she asked her team to set up an in-person meeting with him Ariana felt very hard for Dalton shortly after they met a few months later was when Ariana actually introduced Dalton to her social media followers back to the TMZ article talking about orianna's divorce now Ariana and Dalton have been thousands of miles apart since December when she started filming Wicked our sources say they were having problems even before that we're told they remained friends and still talk on the phone regularly but according to sources the marriage is kaput shortly after this article was released Ariana was actually seen out in public in London and she seemed really happy in these paparazzi photos she looked really nice and although a lot of people are hoping the best for her mentally during this time there's a lot of people pulling up these photos that Ariana had liked around a couple of months ago which could have been the time that they were actually going through problems as the two did reportedly break up months ago these were just some of the Instagram photos that orianna was liking back then one of the fastest ways to destroy emotional safety in a relationship is to weaponize your partner's prior vulnerable share during a subsequent moment of conflict Ariana was also liking these photos captioned never again will I be in a relationship with someone I fear trauma makes you tolerate a lot of ish you don't deserve because you don't want to lose people healing makes you realize some people don't deserve to be in your life no matter how much you love them and these photos were not fake as people were posting screen recordings where it did show that orianna did in fact like these photos there was also this one which was a thread and it talked about four ways to de-escalate a situation with a difficult person and people think that she was insinuating this was all about her relationship with Dalton at the time since she was with joltan all that to say that a new article has come out and it seems like Ariana Grande is now dating but it seems like she's dating one of her co-stars who she is filming on set with AKA Ethan Slater now to preface it's important to note that Ethan is actually married but there are reports being made that he actually recently just divorced or separated with his wife he also does have a kid and people are just like the two both just left a relationship where they were both married what could go wrong TMZ reported just yesterday saying Ariana Grande is dating one of her Wicked co-stars TMZ has learned following her split with hubby Dalton Gomez sources with direct knowledge tell us she and Ethan Slater who plays Bach in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical started dating several months ago during production of the flick it was back in March when a photo circulated showing Ariana and Ethan next to each other as the cast of wicked celebrated Michelle's Oscar win in London TMZ broke the story Ariana and Dalton have yet to file divorce documents though our sources say those are coming but the relationship has been over since January we're told Ariana and Dalton remain friendly and he's been dating as well so it's definitely interesting stuff that are being reported about Ariana Dalton and Ethan Slater there's also a lot of people giving in their opinions about the whole marriage of Ariana and Dalton saying that it seemed like Ariana definitely did Rush the marriage as it was during the pandemic and they got married pretty shortly after that people were even calling it back then saying that it wasn't going to last as for Ethan he's been married to singer Lily J since 2018 and they welcomed his son last year our sources say Ariana and Ethan did not start dating until after he separated from Lily and apparently Lily and Ethan had been dating for around a decade you guys anyways here's what many people over on Reddit have been having to say about this situation right out of a marriage into a relationship with someone who is also right out of a marriage and a co-worker what could possibly go wrong sadly there's also people on Tick Tock making fun of Ariana for her dating toys and basically saying that she could do better so you're telling me that Ariana Grande and this man are together the same man who was SpongeBob on Broadway Ariana Ethan and his wife have known each other since high school she just gave birth last year their anniversary was eight months ago his most recent post on Instagram is him two months ago calling his wife the best person he knows on Mother's day I truly hope that the split was amicable for the good of the child I have a feeling this man is really going to regret this decision throwing away your marriage and family for a pop star who will be on to the next dude in no time a marriage to your grounded high school sweetheart no less that is priceless there is also people in their comments judging orianna for her dating style and saying things like she really can't hold on to one single relationship for a long period of time and or insinuating that maybe she's the problem when it comes to all the guys that she ends up dating if you look at her dating history she's almost always went directly from one relationship to another I think the longest she's been single in her entire career is like two months it's wild they always overlap if you really look I saw a timeline once and oof some of them basically start while she's still in a relationship with someone sometimes even saying she knew someone was her soul mate when she met them while she was with her previous partner Etc some people just can't be single my girl you can stay single for five seconds anyways guys this has been the update on Ariana Grande and her relationship status as well as what people think about her moving on with her co-star I definitely want to know what you guys think about this whole situation in the comments down below Dalton Ariana and Ethan have not yet spoken out about any of this and this is all reported but usually with A-list celebrities like Ariana and Taylor they aren't really going to ever speak out about their relationship status at least that's what it seems especially when they go through a divorce and it kind of just seems like they let the news and media handle it and speak for themselves but I I definitely want to know what you guys think in the comments down below I love you guys so much and as always I'll see y'all in the next video foreign [Music]
07/15/2023,Fans Need to STOP Throwing Objects At Celebrities (it's getting worse),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wMGu1NKaJ0,170-11,it hasn't been a month since Bebe rexa sued a fan for throwing a phone at her and leaving her with stitches and now six other celebrities have been attacked by multiple fans as well all in one week this is getting out of control you guys I understand the excitement of fans trying to throw objects at Celebrities on stage so that they could get noticed by them but it got to a devastating point this week where not only Harry Styles got injured because of this issue but even Taylor Swift Wilma's X Ava Max and so many more so with that being said you guys let's go ahead and address the mess that went down at concerts this week if you're on social media then you probably know that a lot of our favorite celebrities have been touring worldwide this entire summer I mean some of them have been touring for almost two years now while others have been going around the globe performing live at festivals for their fans even though these artists are getting paid to perform it's still pretty cool that some of them are pulling their sweat tears and blood into their performances to entertain their fans because you can rarely find any artist nowadays who are pulling two to three hours Stadium tours such as Beyonce Harry Styles Taylor Swift and many more however things got pretty intense this week with artists performing on stage as many of them got attacked by fans While others were put at risk of getting severely injured by them let's start with Harry Styles who has been touring worldwide for almost two years now it's insane how this man never caught a break since he started his tour but I guess this is the consequence of having one of the most dedicated fan bases out there now earlier this week Harry Styles got hit in the face by an object at one of his shows and let me just say the video that I'm about to show you is extremely disturbing since you can see from the looks on his face how much he was in pain take a look [Applause] oh I mean this was pretty horrible and the fact that Harry Styles refused to say anything about it is also sad as well since he didn't want to ruin the moment on stage and make his fans worried about it the worst part about it is that this exact situation happened to bebe rexa a month ago after she got hit in the face by a phone while she was performing [Music] thank you and while she ended up getting rushed to the hospital for an emergency while that fan committed the crime got fined and locked up in jail because of it to this day now Bebe rexa has been performing on stage while wearing protective eyewear and it's just horrible to see that artists are now taking these precautions while performing live to their fans moving forward now if you thought that fans learned a lesson from Bebe Rex's situation then you're completely wrong since a couple of days ago a video of Drake getting hit by a phone on stage went viral on social media and well as lucky as he is the phone ended up flying away after hitting him in the arm check this out [Music] good girl yeah at this point these artists need a force field or something to stop this because you would think that it is a safe environment for artists to perform live to their fans but I guess it's not despite Drake being lucky unfortunately the country singer Kelsey ballerini suffered an extreme injury earlier this week after a fan threw an object at her on stage that made Kelsey leave her set mid-performance [Music] thank you yeah at some point they're gonna have fans emptying their pockets for concerts by the end of the year if they don't grow up I understand if someone has some kind of hatred towards these artists that are performing but hurting them intentionally on stage and ruining others live performances is a very selfish behavior I mean I'm not sure if you guys have seen this video yet but Ava Max was also one of the targets this week after she got physically attacked by a fan who snuck onto the stage while performing at one of her recent concerts take a look at this Ava Max addressed the issue as soon as her concert was over after she went on Twitter and claimed that the fan slapped her so hard that he scratched the inside of her eye oh my God he slapped me so hard that he scratched the inside of my eye he's never coming to a show again thank you to the fans for being spectacular tonight in La though as soon as Ava Max started trending on social media because of this situation yes who also started trending with Ava as well yes Taylor Swift and you might be asking what is the reason behind it well Taylor Swift also became a victim in the same situation after a video of fans throwing bracelets at her while leaving the stadium went viral come on yes Taylor was able to dodge these bracelets while leaving however this situation made many swifties upset after they went on social media and started calling out the entire fan base for ruining the concerts and putting Taylor at risk speaking of artists dodging objects being thrown at them Wilma's ex was also able to escape an injury on stage earlier this week after a fan threw an inappropriate toy at him while performing check this out [Music] together keep in mind y'all of these clips that I've shown you guys have happened in one week only and the worst part about this is that these threads didn't stop happening again at Pink's recent concerts after one of her fans threw their mother's ashes on stage which left pink shocked and speechless [Music] so you're telling me phones were being thrown first and now people's mothers what is going on at this point honestly it is just sad that all these artists are paying the issue dust without calling out fans and getting them kicked out at the moment and we've only seen that happening at the rapper gorillas concert after she stepped out and got one of the attendees kicked out for trying to throw an object at her I'm trying to have a good [ __ ] out y'all you can tell that this issue has been going on for a while now especially this month although let's not forget many artists who have been struggling with the same issue for years now such as Ariana Grande who got hit with a lemon while performing at Coachella in 2019. [Applause] unfortunately this issue hasn't been fixed ever since and as of lately things have been getting pretty worse because I don't know if you still remember but earlier this year Steve Lacy got canceled all over social media for breaking up fans camera after they attempted to throw it at him while he was performing [Music] be okay [Music] [Applause] at the time millions of people were canceling Steve Lacy because of his actions as not only did they call him rude but they also called him ungrateful for even having fans to watch his concerts however fans are now coming to an understanding about Steve losing his temper over that situation and they believe that he had every right to break the camera that was thrown at him I mean honestly I would have done the same thing if I was in that position and we've seen that happening with rapper sua Lee who got attacked by hundreds of phones on stage earlier this year [Applause] yeah this is extremely unfair at this point and I don't know why artists haven't shed a light on this situation at all although The One and Only Adele came to their defense earlier this week after she spoke about the issue after her recent concert and how she dares anyone to throw anything at her every night [Music] [Applause] with that being said you guys here's what people had to say about the entire situation at this point either concerts are gonna stop or you're just gonna have to go with your clothes on your back what is the sudden urge of fans throwing stuff at artists enough have been injured already why do they keep doing that art is going to be performing by Holograms soon y'all are gonna keep doing this and artists aren't going to tour anymore learn some concert etiquette celebs are humans too anyways loves I would love to hear your opinions on this situation down below but for now make sure to click on the tab above for more videos on these celebrities 
07/01/2023,What Is Going On With Ariana Grandeâ€™s Marriage? (Dalton Gomez CHEATING?!),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7VOKcUqhws,156-12,Ariana Grande's relationship with DaltonGomez has been a talking matter eversince they got together and guys fansrefuse to let these two have their peaceand things about their relationship areconstantly being dug up there's evencheating rumors going around despite thefact that they still claim to be intheir honeymoon phase there have beensome serious accusations against Daltonrecently that sound like he might becheating on Ariana because of her busyschedule which completely ruins theimage of a perfect relationship thatthey've tried to build all these yearsand shockingly there might be some truthto it but first let me take you all theway back to the start the two actuallygot together back in 2020 when she wasstill looking to buy some propertyoutside of LA and when her team TrackedDown Dalton Sparks started to fly Arianawas especially interested in himactually and sources claim that she setthe whole thing up when she saw him sheimmediately thought he was cute and verygood looking and she asked her team toset up an in-person meeting with himAriana felt very hard for Dalton shortlyafter they met their first meeting wasaround February of 2020 before the covidpandemic took over the world so they hada pretty chill start they were even seenout and about like at a bar in LA but ittook a while for them to actually revealtheir relationship and guys theyactually made a pretty cute statement oftheir relationship when they appeared inthe stuck with You music video where sheadded a clip of her and Dalton beingsuper cute together and slow dancing ina bedroom and as the months passed andthe two wasted no time and getting superclose since Ariana's move totally workedand he fell for her pretty hard there'sno doubt in my mind that the pandemicprobably helped them get super close insuch a short amount of time sincethere's basically nothing better to dothan spend time together inside in theprivacy of their own home the two wereactually really private with theirrelationship during all of 2020 theyonly posted a few photos together forthe world to see but by the end of theyear Dalton had apparently gotten downon one knee and popped the big questionit was fast and it was hot and everyoneclaimed they were completely in loveAriana even admitted that Dalton wasextremely special to her which isprobably why they kept things so privatebetween them apparently she sawsomething different in Dalton that shehad never seen before in guys that shepreviously dated and that's saying a lotconsidering she was engaged to bemarried to Pete Davidson before him andwas even in a super serious relationshipwith Mac Miller which also sparkedengagement rumors but at the end of theday nothing could keep Ariana fromDalton and she posted her very famouspicture on Instagram of her big diamondring and even showed off some veryadorable pictures of her and Dalton withthe caption forever and then somesources were saying that Ariana wasbeyond excited about what was to comeand that she even hoped they wouldgenuinely spend the rest of their livestogether and honestly did everything intheir power to get married as fast aspossible since the wedding was held justa few months later in May of 2021everyone said they were absolutely crazyabout each other and the room was sohappy and full of love the couple andboth families couldn't be happier youguys despite the fact that a lot ofpeople thought the marriage was superrushed their relationship seemedliterally perfect many of Ariana's pastrelationships have been in the spotlightbut she is so grateful she's married tosomeone who doesn't care about thatstuff it's really refreshing Ariana evenposted a super cute throwback to theirwedding for this year's second weddinganniversary where she wrote I love himso and everyone around them basicallyclaimed that they were still in theirhoneymoon phase even two years later butguys things are all sunshine andrainbows between the two of them since alot of people have suspected that Daltonmight be hiding something about hissexuality a lot of fans actually believethat Dalton might be gay or at leastbisexual since a lot of people claim hegives off gay Vibes that Dalton Gomezlooks like any ordinary gay come on whatthe I thought Dalton Gomez was hergay best friend and these rumors haveactually been going around non-stop eversince they first got together and peoplereally haven't held back when they wereeven claiming that Dalton was just usingAriana as a beard or that he was onlywith her for the money shockingly a lotof people even claim that Dalton wasinvolved in some sort of gay and thereare even pictures going around a bit butno one has actually been able to confirmif it was actually him or not there areeven some people that people that claimthat dahlin was just trying to get toFrankie through Ariana because Frankieis actually out and it's even become arunning joke of what the two might bedoing behind Ariana's back it's actuallypretty crazy and you can even find a lotof these comments on Ariana's actualsocial media which means she is fullyaware of all of these rumors and evenher own fans are getting tired of it andhave started to call others out on thedisrespectful comments Ariana deservesbetter fans y'all are so mean to thepeople she loves y'all always trash onFrankie and now y'all are trashing onDalton and even Ariana it's so weirdhowever his rumored sexuality isn't theonly reason some fans seem to have aproblem with Dalton as they believe thathe's done some shady things in the pastthere are a lot of rumors going aroundthat Dalton actually only got togetherwith Ariana so that he would have thelife he always dreamed of apparentlyDalton used to live with his parentsbefore he moved in with Ariana and hewasn't even a real estate agent but heonly assisted actual real estate agentssupposedly he even convinced Ariana tobuy them house he was showing herbecause it was his dream house and hewanted to live out his fantasies throughher that alone has a lot of fans raisingtheir eyebrows but what's even worse isthat his family might actually be Trumpsupporters which has made peoplesuspicious of him his sister Tori wasseen wearing a Maga hat out in publicand was even caught liking Trump'stweets on Twitter anyways Dawn was alsoaccused of having a hand in MileyCyrus's downward spiral since he wasapparently a part of the friend groupthat used to hang around Miley and Mileyherself even came out to say that mostof her substance abuse problems came tobe because of a very specific group ofpeople she used to hang around which iswhy people suspect that Dalton mighthave been an influence and there are alot of pictures of the two together fromthat era which really doesn't help theseaccusations it's even rumored that thetwo could have dated in the past butit's nothing anyone has been able toconfirm the worst part is that there areso many other blind items floatingaround about Dalton that may or may notbe true but if they are are they'resuper concerning and Dalton'sproblematic Behavior didn't stop afterhe and Ariana got together and theyactually both got into a scandaltogether in 2021 Dalton posted a videoto his story where you could see him andAriana mocking Native American culturesince they were in the video of peopledancing in a circle which Ariana thenreposted to her story and got a lot ofbacklash for it she basically deleted itagain almost immediately but the damagewas still done a lot of people said thatshe hadn't learned anything from herpast mistakes Ariana Grandedisrespecting indigenous people'scultures Americans have such a longhistory of dehumanizing Native Americansbut shouldn't we hold those with aplatform to a higher standard even ifit's the bare minimum at this pointpeople were pretty much done with bothDalton and Ariana and it really affectedtheir relationship negatively but theystill pushed through it and chose tolook past the hate however recentlythings have started to get pretty tenseand if you guys saw all of this was badjust wait till you hear what he'sallegedly been doing to Ariana andthings might not be as good as they wantus to believe since people are evensaying that they may be heading towardsa divorce at the start of 2023 a lot ofinformation about how Dalton was feelingabout Ari's busy schedule started tosurface since she was always stuck inEurope filming and preparing for hermusical role in Wicked while Daltonstayed back in the U.S the distance hasbeen super rough on their relationshipand sources have come out to say thatthe movie has completely taken over herlife Ariana has been in Australia andEngland for almost a year and she stillhas months left to go her marriage hasdefinitely taken a back seat and it'sbeen a huge strain and y'all it's sotrue that the role basically took overtheir relationship since she actuallyleft to film just a few months afterthey got married which means they reallyhaven't experienced how it is to livetogether as a married couple this mightalso explain why they're saying theystill feel like they're in theirhoneymoon phase since they barely evensee each other the worst part is thatwhen they do see each other they barelycommunicate since Ariana is supposedlysaving her voice for the role whichmeans that they're not even speakingtogether when he does come to visit anda relationship only through text isprobably super hard to maintain sourceshave even revealed that Dalton is soover the whole thing and has said wellDalton is used to her career being apriority his patience has worn thin hejust wants his partner back and yeahthat is super valid especially becausehe's in no way used to dating someonefamous and this is a whole new world forhim and it's super understandable hefeels weird about Ariana's career beingput above their relationship howeverthis looks to have led to some baddecisions if we're to believe the rumorsapparently dumwa who is a superwell-known gossip site that's usuallyright has come out with an anonymousmessage saying this A-list singer hasasked her husband multiple times to flyoverseas to see her but each and everytime he has said no because he is fartoo busy with work uh-huh still has timeto go to clubs and meet women fromonline Dumont even commented on the factthat one of Dalton's friends could havebeen the one to reveal all of this fanswent absolutely crazy with this since itsounded exactly like Dalton'srelationship with Ariana but if it'strue that means Dalton may have beencheating on Ari for months now fans wereabsolutely shocked to hear about itsaying imagine being married to one ofthe biggest stars in the world and beinglike nah I'll see a rando instead likewhat it's absolutely heartbreaking tohear that Ariana might be dealing withall of this especially on top of herstressful work schedule so it's nosurprise that rumors of their divorceare going around something that's madethis whole thing seem even more real isthe fact that Dalton deactivated hisInstagram this year which has beenextremely suspicious to fans a lot ofpeople left comments

lot ofcelebrities on Instagram and accordingto fans Selena Gomez has not onlyunfollowed both Gigi and Bella Hadid butshe even unfollowed Zayn Malik and do aLipa yeahyeah I am not sure how these fans wereable to notice Selena on following themthis quickly but I guess her fan base isalways on track with whoever Selena isfollowing on Instagram now the mainquestion is what is the reason behindSelena unfollowing these specificcelebrities to give y'all a clear answerthere is no answer to that at all no onereally knows what could have happenedbetween Selena and these celebs behindthe scenes however rumors are floatingaround on social media about the dramathat could have happened and whileSelena is getting blamed for it yetagain I don't think I've seen a singlecelebrity receive this much backlashover them unfollowing people onInstagram because Ariana Grande has doneit before to so many celebrities earlierthis year and yet she didn't receive anyattention or hate however when it camedown to Selena Gomez unfollowing a fewof them this week Hell broke loose youguys because a lot of fans startedconnecting this incident to her dramawith the Beavers that went down a fewmonths ago and how this could all be onecontinuous loop if you guys remember thereason why the drama between Selena andHaley happened in the first place wasbecause of how Selena praised BellaHadid all over social media by trying tocopy her laminated eyebrows not only didSelena post a picture of Bella with thehashtag girl crush but she even posted atick tock video about Bella with acaption saying how she wishes she was aspretty as Bella a lot of fans weresurprised to see this going down as itall happened out of the blue and whilethis situation you guys caused a lot ofcontroversies on social media as manypeople started questioning the reasonsbehind Selena praising Bella despiteboth of them being on bad termsthroughout their careers I mean we allknow that both Bella and Selena used todate the weekend a few years backhowever neither of them really likedeach other throughout this phaseespecially when Selena decided to datethe weekend two months after he broke upwith Bella this made Bella extremelyFurious to the point where sheunfollowed Selena on Instagramimmediately although a year after Selenaand the weekend broke up Selena decidedto rekindle her friendship with Bellaafter she followed her again andcommented stunning on her newest post asa way to get close to her as much aspeople expected Bella to return thefavor and reunite with Selena again shedecided to delete the post that Selenacommented on and as a response Lenacommented under a page reporting on theincident by saying that sucks a lot ofpeople felt that Selena was trying sohard to victimize herself as if shedidn't date her friend's Ex two monthsafter they broke up and of course shegot dragged by many people who supportedher for being a manipulator and a toxicfriend although a year after thissituation went down between the two bothSelena and Bella began following eachother on Instagram and liking eachother's posts for a while but for somereason their friendships struggled toremain intact after Bella decided tounfollow Selena on Instagram in 2020.forward to this day you guys Bella hasyet to acknowledge Selena following herdrama surrounding their ex-boyfriend youmight be asking what about Gigi and ZaynMalik because we all know that Gigi andSelena used to be close friends and evenafter Selena and Zayn sparked datingrumors Gigi was extremely supportive oftheir relationship now we all know thatGigi Hadid and Zayn Malik used to be ina public relationship for almost sevenyears and after they ran through tons ofproblems and family issues they decidedto call it quits in late 2021. howevertwo years after they split up Zayn begansparking dating rumors with Selena Gomezafter they decided to follow each otherearlier this year and shortly after thatZayn's own mother followed Selena thenext day as well a week later a sourceconfirms on social media that Zayn andSelena were officially dating after theywere seen going on a date at arestaurant in New York and y'all even atick talker who worked at the restaurantwere both Selena and Zayn had a dateconfirmed that both of them were holdinghands and kissing at their table and Ihave a friend who's also a Hostess andwe both work in restaurants thatcelebrities sometimes go toand tell me why she just sent me this[Â __Â ] text messageand I checked if they even follow eachother and as you can see Zayn onlyfollows 18 peopleSelena being one of themthings then escalated between the couplewhen Selena was seen with Zayn'sassistant leaving a restaurant in NewYork and honestly it was clear at thispoint that something was going onbetween the two especially when Zayn'ssister decided to repost Selena's recentpost on her Instagram stories I wouldn'tlie and say that fans weren'toverwhelmed over this relationship youguys because many of them feared thatGigi might be upset over her ex-frienddating her ex but surprisingly she wasextremely supportive of theirrelationship after she responded to therumors about Selena allegedly dating herex sane by saying this Gigi has noproblem whatsoever with Zayn dating aslong as he is happy and stable andcontinues to be a good co-parent totheir daughter Kai she's fine withwhoever he goes out with after months offans believing that Selena and Zayn weredating Selena decided to clear up everyConfusion by confirming earlier lastmonth that she's single and that she'sjust a little high maintenanceI'm singleI'm just a little high maintenancebut I love you so much to this day youguys no one really knows what happenedwith Zayn and Selena's relationship andwhy it fell off although many fansbelieve now that Zayn and Gigi got backtogether recently hence why Selenadecided to detach herself from them byunfollowing them on Instagram but Ibelieve this rumor is completely falseas tons of sources confirmed that Gigiand Leonardo DiCaprio are still togetherand they're currently in a no stringsrelationship slash open relationship Leoand Gigi have a friendly no stringssituation ship right now they travel sooften so it's best for them to keeptheir relationship open and fluid eitherone of them wants to settle down at themoment as you can see there is still noclear answer surrounding the dramabehind Selena unfollowing Zayn Malik andthe Hadid sisters but unfortunately alot of people are upset over thissituation as not only are they attackingSelena for being better but they're alsodragging her for allegedly being jealousof the Hadid sisters I mean I don'tthink I mentioned this but Dua Lipa wasalso one of the celebrities that Selenaunfollowed this week but for some reasonSelena decided to re-follow Dua Lipaonly which made fans believe that Selenaunfollowed the Hadid sisters out ofjealousy and that she no longer wants toassociate herself with them to make thiseven worse you guys some fans alsoaccused Selena of being islamophobic andthe reason for that is because of howshe unfollowed Zane who is Muslim andthe Hadid sisters who come from a Muslimfamily yeahcan you imagine how far these fans couldgo with accusations not to mention youguys people also body shamed Selenabecause of this situation as theybelieve she was bitter about the Hadidsisters

06/11/2023,Taylor Swift Should STAY AWAY From Matty Healy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdQX_9sG0ZI,144-12,it hasn't been months since Taylor Swift broke up with her boyfriend Joe Owen and now she's sparking dating rumors with a very controversial person Taylor please you can do better we all know the struggle that Taylor Swift faced for years with her relationships with Meg especially men in the industry and she keeps going back to dating more toxic men for some reason it seems though that her new man is officially the worst one she has ever dated throughout her entire career and that is just me being completely honest so without further Ado guys let's just go ahead and address the drama surrounding Taylor Swift's new relationship just imagine how awful it is that after six years Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn have suddenly called it quits over differences in their personalities I mean it's understandable why most people date this long before getting into marriage because they might think that they truly know their partner and their personality when in reality their partner is just giving them an ounce of what they are to them and for Taylor her ex Joe struggled with the level of Fame that she has and he saw from the beginning that he wouldn't be able to handle this level of attention and fame if they ever got into something serious despite all of that you guys both Taylor and Joe spoke no ill of each other after the breakup however tons of fans noticed that many famous followers such as Gigi Hadid Ryan Reynolds and more unfollowed Joe Alwyn on Instagram days after the breakup and while it seemed to fans that Taylor was going around and telling her friends about the Tea about Joe since they were seen recently hanging out together to be honest I'm glad that both Taylor and Joe didn't take this breakup publicly at all because many artists nowadays use this strategy to create a buzz around their careers but for Taylor and Joe they decided to keep things completely private between them and I'm glad that they are on good terms too now if you ask whether the rumors about Joe breaking up with Taylor because of Fame are true I would honestly believe it I mean this man literally broke up with Taylor at the beginning of her eras tour which is considered by far the most popular tour ever in history and I could imagine why Joe made this big decision early because not only is Taylor going to be away from him on tour for months but she's also going to gain a bigger status in the industry than she already has and he just simply doesn't want to be in the spotlight with her at all but I do have to say that Joe did attend the eras tour days after the breakup was announced and honestly he just seems hella supportive of Taylor's career but from a distance of course now you might think that Taylor would take a long break from dating anyone after being in a public relationship for six years well unfortunately that didn't happen in fact the worst thing that you can ever think of happened because weeks after Taylor announced her breakup with Joe she started sparking dating rumors with the 1975 rock band member Maddie Healy according to sources Maddie and Taylor have known each other since 2014 and matter of fact a lot of people believe that they both had a secret fling years ago but that wasn't confirmed to be true by anyone however we've seen them both getting very close lately after Taylor Made a surprise appearance at Maddie's show and even Maddie himself going to Nashville this past month to attend the eras tour around this month blog started reporting that Maddie and Taylor were dating after they both got photographed together in a car for the first time and since then you guys Maddie started appearing everywhere around Taylor what I mean by that is that Maddie started appearing more at the era's tour just to support Taylor but this time he was caught sitting next to Taylor's dad and brother and y'all he was even seen with Taylor in York City leaving a studio by the looks of it Taylor and Maddie seem to be getting more serious with their relationship as they confirmed to news outlets that they're both having The Best Time Ever however the fans on the other hand are extremely upset with the situation going on between Taylor and Maddie because in case you guys haven't realized Maddie is one of the most controversial artists in the Hollywood industry I don't want to sound very harsh but the reason why most people recognize Maddie before he began dating Taylor wasn't really because of his music or his career but in fact he has one of the most disgusting videos ever recorded by fans and these videos went viral months ago on social media after tons of people called him out for being weird and creepy on his tour Maddie was seen chewing into a bloody piece of raw me on stage for absolutely no reason and if you thought this was weird well he was also seen assaulting his videographer on stage after he started dry humping the camera while jumping on her even though you should be creeped out by now uh I would also like to show you videos of Maddie's spitting at the camera on stage making out with a bunch of fans at his show and even kissing his cameraman as well check this out his shows literally feel like a fever dream if I'm being honest and I don't think I would ever attend any of his shows because of it no matter who forces me to anyways despite all that chaos you guys Maddie's behavior on stage doesn't really compare to his islamophobic anti-semitic and racist history you guys because if you know Maddie then you know that his past has been getting brought up for years by now we have a video of Maddie doing a Nazi salute on stage that went viral months ago and we also have a video of Maddie singing the n-word on one of his live streams to this day you guys Maddie has neither apologized nor addressed either of these videos however he continued making offensive comments after he got called out for being misogynistic and racist for making inappropriate comments towards ice spice on a podcast just check this out ice spice you know who that is Nick doesn't know she's like one of the Spice Girls yes she's like she's rapper she's the rapper Inuit spice Maddie also got called out in 2020 for using the BLM hashtag to promote his song which he issued an apology to his fans days later and never made any comments on the situation again to make this even worse you guys Maddie also got dragged by tons of fans for saying the r word on his Instagram Stories equating being Muslim to being in Isis which is a very dangerous View and y'all even standing on the South Korean flag which is considered very disrespectful towards Korean people as the flag is very holy to them I could literally go on for days talking about all the controversial things Maddie has done in the past and is still doing and as a result of that a lot of fans are now sharing their thoughts on Maddie being with Taylor Swift and how this relationship could potentially ruin her image and reputation on the internet here's what fans had to say about Maddie and Taylor's relationship I'm starting to question her morals because how can she label herself a feminist and then date someone who goes against 99 of her alleged beliefs oh Taylor blink twice if you're with him against your will henna in good faith support this woman anymore even as a PR stunt this is vile can we please get that musty man away from Taylor I would love to hear your opinions on the situation down below also don't forget to click on the

06/11/2023,The Tragic Life Story Of Ariana Grandeâ€™s Rise To Fame,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba2lRXjELoU,148-11,I think it's time that we speak on the bullying that Ariana Grande receives on the internet almost every day because this woman has gone from getting body shamed at the early stages of her career to straight up getting her music leaked by fans being a superstar nowadays comes with consequences and unfortunately Ariana Grande was one of those victims as not only does she have a big influence on the older generation but even the current generation as well and for that Ariana has earned one of the biggest followings among other artists which made her become a huge Target for so many people so with that being said let's go ahead and dive deep into the issues that Ariana Grande struggled with during her career we all know that Ariana Grande is one of the greatest musicians of all time not only did she achieve considerable success throughout her career but she also gained such a huge fan base to the point where every generation began falling in love with Ariana's music as her career progressed and while having such a large and dedicated fan base like any other popular celebrity you would think that it's normal for individual to hold negative opinions of Ariana and dislike her however when it came to Ariana popping off in the music scene a lot of people disliked how she was able to become so big to the point where her new songs began surpassing many other celebs and for that they hate towards Ariana began at such an early stage of her career if you know Ariana then you know that this woman suffered from the internet accusing her of black fishing almost every single day and the weird part about it is that this accusation came after some people decided to edit pictures of Ariana on the red carpet to make her look black out of the blue Ariana started going viral for allegedly black fishing after fans noticed a huge difference between her current skin tone and her old ones and to make it even worse she even got accused of trying to act like a black person after she was seen hanging out with black people including her ex Big Sean as much as you would think that these accusations look stupid now at that time Ariana had zero escape from the hate that she was receiving over these lies if you guys have seen my previous video on Ariana then you probably know the amount of body shaming comments people have been leaving under her recent pictures I mean she recently made tons of headlines about her role as Linda for the upcoming movie Wicked after many fans noticed that Ariana's body had progressively gotten worse and worse with each picture she was posting and while she got body shamed all over the Internet following these pictures alone every time you scroll on social media you would see at least someone body shaming Ariana for being skinny making fun of her current body and even comparing her looks to Eugenia Cooney who is struggling with Ed and at that time Ariana was constantly deleting pictures of herself and turning off her comment section whenever people decided to attack her look and call her anorexic of course this situation settled down immediately once Ariana went on Tick Tock to address and express her feelings towards it and as you guys can imagine a lot of fans were extremely happy to see this side of Ariana again as she seemed more vulnerable and open about her feelings to her fan base in this three-minute the body that you've been comparing my current body to was the unhealthiest version of my body I was on a lot of antidepressants drinking on them eating poorly this was probably the first time that Ariana has ever addressed her body online because during the release of her sophomore album my everything Ariana was going on the internet and trying to open up about her struggle so she could connect with her fans more and make them feel seen but unfortunately this situation backfired on her for some reason after many fans started pointing out how Ariana Grande lost a lot of weight in under a year of course this conversation opened a debate on social media about Ariana's health and whether people around her are overworking her during this era or not as her weight difference became apparent despite Ariana not addressing the rumors about her health she still made it clear to her fans that she is in fact vegan and she has always been vegan since she was a child but still fans found it strange how Ariana became super skinny compared to the release of her debut album and for that they started arguing online that being vegan had nothing to do with Ariana losing weight but instead she's either starving herself or her team is overworking her I mean have you guys forgotten about how people straight up made a challenge about Ariana's weight loss during this era yeah guys as worse as this could get you guys some fans even thought that mentioning Ariana's weight during this era could help promote her album somehow because they decided to make a challenge where they recreate Ariana Grande's pose for her album my everything on a small chair and as you guessed it this challenge went viral immediately the amount of hate Ariana received from fans attempting this challenge was insane I mean people were constantly posting pictures of themselves attempting this Challenge online some of them were even failing on purpose just to go on social media and joke about how Ariana is the only person who could face zero struggles sitting on a tiny chair it's crazy how far the internet can go when it comes to women and their bodies because no one was speaking up for Ariana at that time while she was witnessing every hate comment about her online after years of people constantly bullying Ariana Grande for her weight loss unfortunately this woman got involved in another internet discussion following her sweetener album release only this time you guys people noticed that Ariana gained a bit of weight following her breakup with Mac Miller and the tragic incident that happened in Manchester now I wouldn't say that a lot of people weren't happy about Ariana gaining some weight since she was concerning a lot of fans throughout the years for being way too skinny but during the sweetener era you guys a lot of fans felt that Ariana was the healthiest she's ever been as she seemed in quote unquote normal for some reason however one thing that people didn't know was that Ariana was actually suffering mentally and physically regarding the Manchester incident that went down back in 2017. I know this topic is a bit sensitive for some people so I'm gonna put a trigger warning for you guys in this case but during the sweetener era you guys this album was supposed to be all about healing morning failed relationships and even exploring new chapters in life and the main reason why Ariana made this album in the first place was because of the tragedy that went down at her concert in Manchester her back in 2017. as you guys know back in 2017 and Ariana Grande concert in Manchester got targeted by a terrorist attack while fans were leaving the venue after 100 of them got injured and 22 others passed away the incident shocked the world and was widely condemned as an act of Senseless violence it traumatized many people who witnessed the attack happening and even Ariana as well who thankfully was unhurt during the act at that time Ariana took a long break to grieve and help as many fans in need as she expressed her condolences and solidarity with the victims and their families and y'all she even organized the one love Manchester benefit concert just a few weeks later to raise funds for the victims and honor those affected by the attack I wouldn't lie and say that Ariana was in a good place at that time because she was constantly going on interviews trying to apologize for the fans who lost their lives and got traumatized from the incident going back to Manchester and doing a benefit I thought that was awesome of you and so I just think you're so strong that's so cool [Applause] get her she went on and to open up about her struggles with depression and how the Manchester attack really affected her mentally I was saying that you you um had sat and had therapy and and have really been working through recovering from what took place in Manchester it's just about like um like just being there for each other and like helping each other through scary times and like anxiety some dark [ __ ] out there man so we just have to like be there for each other as much as we can despite how Ariana was struggling with both the Manchester attack and the breakup between her and Mac Miller people still managed to find ways to blame her for the Manchester incident by telling her that it was all her fault and this wouldn't have happened if she didn't perform there not only that but some people were even poking fun at Ariana online by calling her many offensive names regarding the attack and of course this resulted in Ariana suffering from PTSD following the tragic event Ariana Grande opened up about experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after she expressed feelings of anxiety fear and Hyper vigilance which are common symptoms of PTSD and y'all Ariana even shared a photo of her brain scan on her Instagram stories which revealed how post-traumatic stress disorder had heavily impacted her brain ever since Ariana has been candid about seeking therapy and counseling to cope with her trauma and she has dedicated a song on her sweetener album for the ones who lost their lives at her concert titled get well soon now a year after this situation went down and Ariana released her sweetener album she's started storing tons of controversies on social media after many fans pointed out how Ariana was allegedly shading her ex Max Miller in a couple of songs and at that time you guys Ariana was in a relationship with Pete Davidson so the internet was already against her for that as many of them shipped Ariana with Mac Miller more unfortunately you guys not a month after Ariana released her album sweetener back in 2018 her ex Mac Miller sadly passed away due to opening and as you can guess tons of people started blaming her ex's death on Ariana nearly all Twitter headlines mentioned Ariana's name when referring to Miller even though she was in no way related to his death and y'all even Twitter users were trending the hashtag hashtag Ariana killed Mac Miller all over social media and blaming her for causing Mac to overdose I can't describe it but the hate was so extreme that Ariana was forced to disable her comment section on Instagram as many people were blaming Mac Miller's passing to Ariana breaking up with him and releasing Shady songs towards him after almost three years of Ariana suffering from online hate Ariana began slowly distancing herself from the music scene as it became way too toxic to even be online and present with her fans however following the launch of her beauty brand REM Beauty Ariana got involved in another huge scandal after she was accused by millions of people of Asian teaching this accusation came after Ariana made multiple Instagram posts wearing her beauty products on her face to promote it to her fans on Instagram but for some some reason a lot of people disliked how her face completely changed during this era as not only did they get accused of getting a brow lift to look Asian but they also made fun of her online for getting surgeries done to her face not to mention you guys this wasn't the first time that Ariana has been accused of trying to look Asian and appropriating other cultures despite all that Ariana did not hold back from responding to fans accusing her of appropriating Japanese culture and while this was the response she made on Twitter following the hate she received regarding her Japanese aesthetic merch too there's a difference between appropriation and appreciation my Japanese fans were always excited when I wrote in Japanese or wore Japanese sayings on my clothing however all of the merch with Japanese on it was taken down from my site not that anyone cared to notice two years after Ariana released both albums thank you next and positions which was her last Ariana made the decision to take a long break from music to put more effort into her beauty brand since the beauty industry is a very competitive place and as a result of that fans started paying thousands of dollars to leak music that Ariana never got the chance to release officially and that's when Hell broke loose you guys I wouldn't know how to feel if I went on the internet one day and saw my own fans paying tens of thousands of dollars to leakers just to listen to the music I refused to based on streaming platforms well yes that's what happened with Ariana Grande this month because many fans expected her to release new music soon after being gone from the music scene for a hot minute and keep in mind Ariana's schedule was very tight at that time as she was not only focusing on creating new products for REM Beauty and trying to compete with other brands but she was also trying to film two roles for her upcoming movie Wicked so there was no way that Ariana would even be prepared to return to music and start a new era while she had other important projects going on in her life however she did give her fans something to keep them silent after she released a Remax to the weekend song die for you out of nowhere and while you can't imagine the amount of fans who are excited to hear Ariana's voice because at that moment people thought that oh Ariana is back feeding her fans with new music however things started going downhill from that point after tons of fans started demanding a new album from Ariana and at that moment Ariana had no chance but to be fully transparent with her fans after she hit them with the hard truth that she hasn't even started with her new album yet the truth is I have not begun an album I know I hear Through the Grapevine that you have a lot of theories and expectations in the department but after positions was not ready to start another album yet so I have not begun another album I'm pretty sure sure that Ariana knew the consequences of this announcement because not only did she start trending on Twitter but fans started leaving the fandom and Gathering almost a hundred thousand dollars to buy Ariana's unreleased music this started after some Anonymous people who worked with Ariana began selling the music she made in their Studio but didn't put out and as a result fans started buying almost every single one of them to the point where the majority of her unreleased songs got leaked on the internet in seconds some fans even spent hundreds of dollars to buy photo shoot sessions that Ariana had for her album positions and to make this even worse you guys they gathered three thousand dollars to buy an unreleased Ariana Grande music video for her song POV after they had asked Ariana to release it a couple of years ago but she refused to do it even though hundreds of projects were getting leaked by fans all over the internet people were still excited to see the new projects from Ariana whether they were recorded years ago or not and well you can imagine how Ariana felt about her fans spending thousands of dollars on rejected songs from her because she recently went on Instagram to call out her fans by saying this in her video you've stolen all my unreleased music it's horrible it's pretty obvious that Ariana was pissed at her private music getting leaked because as much as she was trying her best to be calm and poke fun at this situation it still sucks that her music got leaked by her own fan base without her permission despite all that you guys fans are still being delusional about Ariana returning to the music scene again after she archived the majority of her Instagram posts despite Ariana still shooting her two movies while trying her best to manage REM Beauty and other than that it was also rumored that Ariana was releasing a remix to Beyonce's song Plastic off the sofa as she recently went to her concert in London and gave millions of fans hope Ariana stands living off week's songs I understand that we want music but this is

04/21/2023,Loren Gray EXPOSES The Ugly Truth About Coachella..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCusn6bRI40,145-14,it's that time of year again where influencers and celebs get exposed for being Reckless at Coachella only this time you guys Lauren Gray was the one who revealed the entire truth about our favorite influencers and things got pretty chaotic aside from Lauren Gray exposing the entire influencer industry Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes also sparked dating rumors after they were caught making out at Coachella and even Frank Ocean got canceled for starting his Coachella set very late leaving thousands of fans freezing in the desert we're gonna get into all of that in just a second so without further Ado let's talk about Lauren Gray first I'm not sure if you guys had any idea that Coachella was happening this week because for whatever reason this year's Coachella made absolutely no noise I mean do you guys remember when people would go on social media to share their excitement over Coachella months prior to the global event and those people weren't even attending the show they were only excited to watch their favorite artists perform and watch influencers go with their luxurious outfits it's just crazy how Coachella went downhill after covet happened because ever since they decided to bring it back in 2022 things haven't been the same at all if you ask me I feel like the best part about Coachella was the drama that went down between many popular celebs and influencers because we've seen that happening with James Charles versus toddy Westbrook and the entire Beauty Community a couple of years ago but in case you were asking whether there was drama going on during the first weekend of Coachella or not um I would say absolutely in fact Lauren 1:34 1:36 1:38 1:39 1:42 1:44 1:46 1:48 1:50 1:52 1:55 1:56 1:58 2:00 2:02 2:04 2:07 2:08 2:10 2:12 2:14 2:17 2:18 2:20 2:22 2:24 2:26 2:28 2:31 2:33 2:35 2:36 2:38 2:40 2:42 2:45 2:47 2:49 2:51 2:54 2:56 2:58 3:01 3:03 3:04 3:06 3:08 3:10 3:12 3:14 3:15 3:17 3:19 3:20 3:22 3:24 3:26 3:28 3:30 3:32 3:34 3:36 3:38 3:40 3:41 3:43 3:46 3:48 3:50 3:53 3:54 3:56 3:57 4:00 4:02 4:04 4:07 4:08 4:10 4:12 4:14 4:16 4:18 4:20 4:23 4:24 4:26 4:29 4:30 k with your ex is never a good idea despite how kamiya made it clear that she was dating Sean sources are now confirming that the couple was not back together and that the kiss happened between them at Coachella was a one-time thing honestly who knew what could have gone down between them privately but with that being said you guys let's end today's video with Frank Ocean getting canceled by millions of fans for messing up his Coachella performance imagine how embarrassing it is for you to mess up an entire performance at Coachella after being on a break for six years years as you guys probably know people have been talking about Frank Ocean ever since he was announced to headline Coachella 7:23 7:25 7:27 7:28 7:30 7:33 7:36 7:37 7:39 7:41 7:43 7:45 7:47 7:48 7:50 7:52 7:54 7:56 7:58 8:00 8:03 8:05 8:06 8:08 8:10 8:12 8:14 8:16 8:19 8:29 o many passes the fans let him get away with giving them breadcrumbs and this is the result this was such a letdown like honestly we left early after many fans expressed their anger and frustration over Frank's performance his management team decided to make a response the next day towards people who were blaming Frank and y'all they revealed that Coachella was to blame in the situation since Frank reportedly requested significant last minute changes to his Stage production which resulted in Coachella scrapping off the majority of his performances and causing delays and tension with the festival organizers some sources also reported that Frank was still mourning his brother and the only reason why he performed there was to pay tribute to him since they used to go to Coachella together either way we still have no idea whether Frank's management team was being truthful but I would love to read your comments on the situation down below also make sure to click on the tab above for more videos on these celebs      
04/14/2023,The Aftermath Of Ariana Grandeâ€™s Lookalike Is DISTURBING..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twoa159f99E,140-13,so are we gonna ignore the fact that this Ariana Grande look alike is still profiting off of Ariana only this time she's actually using it to promote her only fans this is so dark and disturbing on so many levels you know it's crazy to see how Paige Neiman AKA Ariana Grande's look alike is still a trending topic on social media for over three years now but for some reason people are now canceling her for going way too far with her impersonation so without further Ado guys let's just go ahead and address what went down with Paige this week I'm glad that people are finally realizing how bad and disturbing it is for Paige to impersonate Ariana Grande for a living because no one seemed to care about it as much as her fans did however ever since Paige Neiman blew up on Tick Tock a couple of years ago fans have been constantly trolling her and sending her death threats every day the reason for that is because Paige went from looking like Ariana Grande to literally copying her style and trying to be her I mean you cannot watch these Tick Tock videos without telling me that this girl wasn't straight up mimicking Ariana Grande it's obvious why Paige continued posting videos of her impersonating Ariana because at one point she started trending on Twitter for days with thousands of people sharing their opinions on her and with that Paige immediately blew up on social media after she gained millions of followers on Tick Tock in literally hours and y'all she even got asked to do multiple interviews just for looking like Ariana Grande with all of the public attention of course Ariana stumbled upon one of the videos that Paige posted of her mimicking her Idol and y'all not only did Ariana have a total freak out about it but she even called Paige out for impersonating her and her voice by saying this I just wonder why the catboy slash dialogue I am sure she is the sweetest sweet sweetheart for real but it's definitely bizarre seeing people blend the Two Worlds LMAO even though Ariana had the right to drag Paige for being weird she still managed to delete her tweet immediately afterwards so her fans would stop hating on page but she did go on Instagram the next day to show share her frustration over people still trying to copy her and make fun of her personality how at Ariana Grande washes her hands man if y'all don't leave me alone this made me so anxious there's no doubt that Ariana was actually annoyed with how people were using her style and personality to gain attention however everything took a turn once Paige Neiman went on multiple interviews including Entertainment Tonight and revealed that Ariana Grande actually dm'd her privately and that they both are cool with each other after Ariana allegedly expressed her love towards her check this out did she slide into the DMS yeah what did she say she said I'm flattered she just wanted to let me know that I'm beautiful in my own way and I said thank you and thank you for being so kind to me and she said like I'm proud of you as much as Paige wanted Ariana Grande to show love and support towards her unfortunately things turned out to be the opposite after Ariana went on her Instagram stories days later to throw shade at page and her other lookalikes for impersonating her this is my impression of a meme OMG can this please also double as your impression of the ponytail Tick Tock girls who think doing the Cat Valentine voice and wearing that winged eyeliner and a sweatshirt is doing a good impersonation of me because this really how it feels degrading its entire value I screamed of course Paige took to Instagram immediately to express her sadness over Ariana's shading her because not only did she try to gain sympathy from fans by saying that she's used to Ariana shading her but she even opened up about how hurt she was about it as well if you were to ask me a couple of years ago if Ariana did the right thing I would have said no to be honest because at first Paige wasn't really harming anyone with her content and for her to get bullied when she was only 15 years old is kind of ridiculous although for some reason Ariana Grande just seemed annoyed with the content that Paige was putting out on social media because she continued making fun of Paige on Twitter by responding to fans with tweets saying it's funny because because you're lying I be nice literally every vid I see of someone trying to somewhat mimic you it's always a connection with Cat Valentine instead of the actual you oof I mean it made sense why Ariana let all of her anger out on Paige because she has seen the exact same scenario going on with Gabby dimartino and Emery Birmingham mimicking her for years in a very harmful way [Music] my iced black coffee tastes pretty good as long as I put some sweetener in it but does that justify Ariana attacking Paige and making her fans bully her I don't think that was the right choice however after Paige took a long break from social media following all the hate she then decided to delete the majority of her old Tick Tock videos of her impersonating Ariana and at that time people thought that Paige wanted to fix her image to the public and change as a person until she went on Instagram to mimic Ariana Grande Again by copying her wedding pictures with these photos and y'all she even copied Ariana's tattoos and hairstyle after she remade Ariana's album cover in an Instagram post it's funny how people thought that Paige took that break to reflect on herself and her actions when in fact she was preparing more content to piss people off because not only did she continue copying Ariana by replicating her music videos but she even released her own merch that had an animated picture of Ariana on it which was just too far after fans witnessed how Paige was straight up profiting off of Ariana they decided to go after her tick tock account and report it for impersonation until it got permanently banned however she was able to come back after a couple of days later and since then no one has heard anything about Paige at all yes she was still posting and impersonating Ariana this entire time but I feel like people were just tired of addressing her on social media and giving her attention whenever she mimics Ariana and that's why they made the decision to ignore her and pretend that she doesn't exist forward to this year you guys Paige Neiman started making headlines again after she announced that she will be joining all the fans and charging people 13 a month but the twist in this you guys is that she will be cosplaying as Ariana Grande in her only fans content I wish I was joking Paige took to Instagram to make this announcement after she posted inappropriate pictures of her with the same makeup and hairstyle as Ariana the last picture is also me Lincoln bio and y'all even if you go to her only fans page it says that she's not cosplaying or impersonating any celebrity despite her profile cover being a picture of her dressed up as Ariana exclusive of content that you wouldn't normally see from me 18 plus not cosplaying or impersonating this situation you guys made millions of fans upset and Furious in fact Paige started trending again on Twitter with tons of people making hate tweets about the situation that gained more than a hundred thousand likes and to make this even worse some fans also advised Ariana to sue page and file a lawsuit for this case as it could be illegal for her to change her appearance to mimic someone else for monetary gain here's what people had to say about it changing your appearance to look exactly like a celebrity then using that to promote your only fans is so dark Ariana really needs to start suing these people like this is so much more Sinister than normal impersonation if I was Ariana I would hire a hitman IDK this is almost like the real life situation of deep fake whoa Paige has yet to respond to the backlash she received over her only fans announcement but apparently she's been super busy posting on her only fans page as she reads only gained more than 500 supporters on the platform I would like to hear your opinions on the situation down below but for now make sure to click on the tab above for more controversial

04/09/2023,Ariana Grandeâ€™s Weight Loss Is CONCERNING..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrgvqmb7kN8,136-16,for those of you who don't know people have been bullying Ariana Grande for losing a lot of weight well have gotten worse you guys because not only are now people concerned for Ariana and her health but they're also accusing her of having an Ed and comparing her weight loss to Eugenia Cooney when is this gonna end as sensitive as a topic this is unfortunately you guys some people still believe that Ariana Grande's Health needs to be discussed since she's been trending on social media for days and all I can say is that it was not for the right reasons so without further Ado you guys let's just jump right in and go to the beginning where it all started ever since Ariana Grande began acting for Nickelodeon you guys she's been getting bullied and harassed by a lot of people on the internet including members of her own Nickelodeon crew yeah I'm not sure if you guys still remember but a couple of years ago tons of rumors and accusations started resurfacing out of nowhere about Ariana and how she was allegedly a victim of Dan Schneider now I know you're asking yourself who the hell is Dan Schneider well while Dan Schneider is a former Nickelodeon producer who worked on several of the Network's popular shows including Victorious which Ariana starred in and while some fans and media Outlets believe that there may have been inappropriate behavior or an inappropriate relationship between Ariana and Dan this rumor came after Dan received criticism in the past for his management style and his treatment of young actors and how he allegedly made a lot of former child actors who had worked with him feel uncomfortable or mistreated on set of course people started connecting this accusation about Dan to Ariana Grande and how she might have been bullied by Dan on set as well after many crew members came to reveal some information and that's when things went downhill you guys since not only did Dan get exposed for sexualizing many cast members in the show but he also got exposed for forcing Ariana to do inappropriate stuff on camera check this out you guys that could never happen because your uvula is that swingy thing in the back of your throat right here foreign you could get it stuck between a hamster's toes after tons of videos and accusations about Dan started resurfacing on the internet many people started becoming concerned about Ariana's mental health and how she might have been traumatized by Dan throughout all these years however Ariana herself has not publicly spoken about any negative experiences with Dan Schneider in fact she has been generally supportive of Schneider in interviews by thanking him for giving her a start in the entertainment industry and praising him for his Creative Vision so it's unclear whether there was any inappropriate behavior or relationships between the two but a lot of people still believe that Ariana faced a lot of issues with Dan in the past and she's only hiding the truth because he gave her a push in her career anyways after Ariana moved from her acting career and began releasing songs she received a lot of praise and love for her work and talent following her debut album yours truly and to be honest this might have been one of the biggest moments in Ariana's career because the amount of support she received from fans felt like a dream to her however all all of this took a wild turn once Ariana decided to release her sophomore album my everything which opened up a lot about her personal struggles and from the beginning you guys people noticed that Ariana Grande had lost a lot of weight during this era yeah guys not only did she get body shames for looking way too skinny in the cover art of her album my everything but she also got bullied throughout this entire era for not taking care of her health and eating well this situation opens a lot of conversations on social media about Ariana Grande's body to the point where some people decided to make a challenge whether they could recreate Ariana Grande's pose for her album my everything on a small chair and of course you can imagine the hate Ariana received for it since many people failed to do the challenge as they described Ariana to be way too skinny and petite for her to sit on a small chair anyways after years of people constantly bullying Ariana Grande for her weight loss unfortunately this woman got involved in another internet discussion following her sweetener album release only this time you guys people noticed that Ariana gained a little bit of weight following her breakup with Mac Miller and the tragic incident that happened in Manchester I wouldn't say that a lot of people weren't happy about Ariana gaining some weight since she was concerning a lot of fans throughout the years from being way too skinny but during this era you guys a lot of fans felt that Ariana was the healthiest she's ever been until Ariana made the decision to take a break from releasing music years later to focus on launching her makeup brand REM Beauty I'm not sure whether this was the right decision for Ariana or not because if we're talking success wise Ariana's Beauty brand was killing it on the market as it became one of the top highest selling makeup brands worldwide however this decision you guys made Ariana distance herself from her fans as not only she deactivated her Twitter account following the hate but she also made her entire Instagram account based on her makeup brand and not her as an artist this situation affected many fans who supported Ariana and as a result a lot of people took to social media to bully Ariana and accuse her of Asian fishing after pictures of her wearing her makeup products on her face went viral for some reason a lot of people didn't understand that Ariana had to wear a lot of makeup on her face to promote her beauty brand as many of her fans were not used to seeing her be this glammed but unfortunately this was only the beginning of the end because a couple of months after Ariana got accused of Asian fishing she then got bullied for losing tons of weight for her role in the upcoming movie Wicked I don't want to be dramatic but this was probably the worst time I've ever seen Ariana getting bullied for her weight because not only were people accusing Ariana of having an Ed but they were also comparing her looks to Eugenia Cooney who also struggles with an ed check this out Ariana is turning into Eugenia Cooney if we can openly worry about Eugenia girl I think it's time we start worrying about Ariana why does Ariana look like Eugenia Cooney now during this time Ariana was constantly deleting pictures and turning off her comment section whenever people decided to come after her looks and her weight although this week you guys no one could have stopped people from bullying Ariana regarding her weight after a couple of pictures of her posing with cast members of her upcoming movie went viral on Twitter and of course not only did Ariana start trending for looking way too old in her new pictures but she also made headlines after tons of people accused her of being anorexic here's what people had to say Ariana Grande is anorexic and people saying that she's always been skinny have no clue she's aging miserably I've lived with anorexia for eight years now and I know it when I see it no one looks naturally that skinny she looks unhealthy it's crazy that despite all these years of Ariana facing criticism and bullying she has continued to be an advocate for body positivity and self-love and she has inspired many people around the world to embrace their unique qualities and to feel comfortable and confident

03/31/2023,Selena Gomez SHUTS DOWN Rumors On Dating Zayn Malik...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbXlMn7oFU,0-20,wow  ot only is Selena Gomez getting called out by the entire internet right now for dating the one and only Zayn Malik but she's also getting dragged for turning against Gigi and Bella Hadid who saw this coming really apparently you guys Selena Gomez has a very dark history when it comes to her relationships with celebrities and no I'm not talking about her situation with Justin Bieber this time because the way she got accused of being a homewrecker and betrayer all in one day left me wondering why people would turn against her all of a sudden I guess you guys have to stay tuned to find out what really happened so without further Ado let's not wait any longer and Jump Right In you know it's kind of sad how Selena went through a lot with her relationships in the past especially after she broke up with Justin Bieber and left millions of fans shocked but what some of y'all don't know is that Justin wasn't the only one who moved on and found the love of his life which was Haley Bieber in fact Selena Gomez began dating the weekend shortly after she broke up with Justin and that's when things started going downhill for her now you might be asking what's so wrong about Selena dating the weekend well in case you guys might have forgotten the model Bella Hadid and the weekend were in a public relationship for almost two years and after they had a big breakup in November 2016 Selena and the weekend began sparking dating rumors two months later at first people were confused whether the weekend and Bella had already broken up a long time ago or the weekend just simply moved on from Bella immediately but then things took a turn once Bella Hadid decided to unfollow Selena on Instagram following the rumors about her relationship with her ex the weekend this situation made many people wonder whether the weekend was cheating on Bella with Selena throughout their entire relationship or not because as soon as Selena got unfollowed by Bella Selena then hit the unfollow button in Return of course fans took to social media to discuss the reasons Bella might have ended her friendship with Selena over the weekend because as far as we knew both Selena and the Hadid sisters had been close friends for years and years and for them to cut each other off felt a bit weird anyways after Selena and the weeknd's relationship became official things then started falling apart between the two as they slowly began distancing themselves from each other and shortly after that they decided to end their 10-month relationship on good terms and remain friends however seven months after the weekend and Selena split up Bella Hadid then entered the scene again and decided to rekindle her romance with the weekend only for it to fall apart again because of Selena yeah guys just imagine how messy this actually was according to reliable sources you guys Bella felt very threatened by Selena throughout her relationship with the weekend as Selena allegedly spoke to the weekend from time to time which infuriated Bella a lot and to make it even worse you guys Bella also feared that Selena might rekindle her romance with the weekend following their breakup in 2019 because not only did Selena try to be on Bella's good side after that but she also played the victim in this situation and pretended that she didn't break the girl code yep I'm not sure if you guys will remember but back in 2019 Selena got called out by millions of people after she decided to follow Bella again and comment stunning on her newest post just to make it seem that the two of them were on good terms but then things took a wild turn when Bella decided to delete the post that Selena commented on and as a response Selena commented under a page reporting on the incident by saying that sucks a lot of people felt that Selena was trying so hard to victimize herself as if she didn't date her friend's Ex two months after they broke up and of course she got dragged by many people who supported her for being a manipulator and a toxic friend although you're after the situation went down between the two Selena and Bella began following each other on Instagram and liking each other's posts for a while but for some reason their friendship struggled to remain intact after Bella decided to unfollow Selena on Instagram again in 2020. forward to this year Selena got called out again for trying to contact Bella again after she went on Instagram stories to post a picture of Bella with the hashtag girl crush and y'all she even posted a tick tock video about Bella with a caption saying that she wishes she was as pretty as Bella to be honest it wasn't really shocking that people were sending hate towards Selena for obsessing over Bella of a sudden because following their friendship history this girl support tactic from Selena came out of nowhere and it kind of made people wonder the reason behind it despite all of that you guys Bella remained silent throughout this entire drama in fact she even refused to follow Selena back on Instagram after she recently followed her anyways let's move on now to her sister Gigi Hadid because even though Bella and Selena were allegedly friends back in the day Gigi and Selena instead were very close I mean according to sources Gigi and Selena met through Taylor Swift over 10 years ago and since then they became close friends as they started hanging out together publicly with their entire friend group however the drama that went down recently between Gigi and Selena made me question their entire friendship and whether Selena and Gigi had altercations behind the scenes in case you guys didn't know Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik used to be in a public relationship for almost seven years and after they ran through tons of problems and family issues they decided to call it quits in late 2021. of course their relationship became a huge topic on media platforms as millions of people were devastated over their split up and how their newborn daughter would be affected by this decision but thankfully you guys it seems like the baby is in good hands now after Selena Gomez became her soon to be stepmom I wish I was joking as we previously addressed in my video Selena and Zayn have been sparking dating rumors for a while now after they both decided to follow each other on Instagram and shortly after that Zayn's own mother followed Selena the next day as well a week later a source confirms on social media that Zayn and Selena were officially dating after they were seen going on a date at a restaurant in New York and y'all even after a tick-tocker who worked at the restaurant where both Selena and Zayn had a date confirmed that both of them were holding hands and kissing at their table so I'm on my way home from work and I'm a Hostess in New York City and I have a friend who's also a Hostess and we both work in restaurants that celebrities sometimes go to and tell me why she just sent me this text message and I checked if they even follow each other and as you can see Zayn only follows 18 people Selena being one of them at first people were wondering whether this rumor was true or not since a lot of tick-tockers nowaday lie about stuff just to gain clout and attention but then things got a bit more interesting when Selena was seen with Zayn's assistant leaving a restaurant in New York it was clear at this point that something was going on between the two especially after Zane's sister reposted Selena's recent post on her Instagram stories however the fans on the other hand were extremely upset over this situation since many of them felt that Selena betrayed both of the Hadid sisters after not only she took the weekend from Bella but she took Zane from GG shortly after they broke up here's what people had to say about the situation wait Selena's dating Zayn who dated Gigi whose sister is Bella who dated the weekend who Selena dated that's interesting just seconds after making up with Haley Bieber she enters Gigi hadid's territory Selena Gomez is becoming a pigment I find it weird how out of all the men Selena picked Zayn he dated Gigi and literally has a child with her she dated Abel II hopped from the Beavers to the Hadid real quick Selena and Zayn please this girl is obsessed with the hadids aren't she supposed to be in the same friend group as Gigi yeah guys a lot of people started saying that Selena has been obsessed with Zayn this entire time after an old interview of her being asked whom she would kiss from One Direction went viral and of course she chose Zayn Malik who would you pick for a kiss oh no Zayn maybe that's it I'm done there was no hesitation there despite all of the drama that people were trying to create between Gigi and Selena Gigi actually responded to the rumors about Selena allegedly dating her ex Zane and y'all this is what an Insider told us magazine Gigi has no problem whatsoever with Zayn dating as long as he is happy and stable and continues to be a good co-parent to their daughter Kai she's fine with whoever he goes out with I would love to hear your opinions on this situation down below but for now make sure to click on the tab above for more videos on these celebs 
03/21/2023,Bad Bunny is in Trouble (sued by ex + kardashian curse),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEre0I1xrLg,122-18,Bad Bunny has been in the headlines a lot lately after rumors have gone around that he's dating Kendall Jenner the news alone has gotten him in some trouble as people are not fans of the Kardashian Jenner family and we're really surprised to see him hanging around one of the members leaving some Vans to feel sort of betrayed by him associating with family that some have called culture vultures and are just surprised that he would want to be around someone in the family some have even joked that dating a Kardashian member comes with a certain Kardashian curse as not so wonderful things have happened said the men in the past who have dated one of these sisters and not just stated because some people even include Rob in this Theory and just say that anyone associated with the Kardashian in general bad things happen to them and with Bad Bunny in the headlines this week for something non-cardashian related some feel like this curse might have hit him you've probably heard the conspiracy theory that the Kardashians curse all the men in their lives and ruin them while they thrive of this include Rob Kardashian from being happy and offered modeling gigs to developing severe depression and never leaving his house Scott Disick who went from being a preppy successful businessman to developing severe alcoholism and depression in front of the whole world Lamar Odom who is at the top of his basketball game that experienced severe addiction overdose died and then was brought back to life Reggie Bush who went for winning Heisman Trophies to shortly after dating Kim having to retire because he got injured and then started playing way worse and had to give his Heisman Trophy back because of a scandal he was in Travis Scott having a number one album in 2018 then becoming the most hated disgrace artist of all time and not releasing an album since Caitlyn Jenner who ruined her relationship with Chris Kim Courtney and Chloe and then got ostracized by her own Community Kanye going on his first 5150 psychiatric hold being locked in a mental hospital his 2020 presidential run and him literally saying he was in the sunken place when he was with Kim Pete Davidson now being in trauma therapy after the negative media attention from being with Kim even though it's not confirmed that he's dating Kendall and Kendall is a Jenner not a Kardashian some still felt like the curse was applying to him since this week news broke that he's being sued by one of his ex-girlfriend his egg scarlease is suing him for at least 40 million dollars over a well-known voice recording that she did for him before he was famous where she says Bad Bunny baby the recording was included in two of his songs and she is claiming in a lawsuit that her voice and the phrase she came up with are being used without her permission and it's not just songs that she feels her voice has been used for the lawsuit states that her distinguishable voice also has been used without her consent for songs records promotions worldwide concerts television radio and social and musical platforms aside from Bad Bunny himself she also seems to be suing his manager as well now these two have a very long history and they dated for quite a while before he was famous I believe they started dating in 2011 and it wasn't until 2015 that she actually did this recording of Bad Bunny baby in which she said that he was working on some music and he texted her wanted her to record this she was with a friend she went to the bathroom where it was the most quiet and recorded it and sent it over to him and in 2016 they actually got engaged and made plans to get married that same year but it was also the hero that he was signed and she got accepted to law school and they ended up breaking up I believe they tried to get back together again but it didn't work out and they ended up going at separate ways I believe there's like more to that but that's as much as I know now the tea of all of this is that back in 2022 there was actually discussions of them about to use her voice for one of his upcoming albums and somebody representing Bad Bunny actually called her up and said that he was willing to give her two thousand dollars if he could use her voice and she said no they never agreed on anything but the audio was used anyway like despite the fact that she declined this offer like they just wouldn't have been put it on the album and the lawsuit claims that people know it's her and since it's released thousands of people have commented directly on her social media networks as well as every time she goes out in public people are always making comments about Bad Bunny baby and the lawsuit states that this has caused and currently causes her to feel worried anguished intimidated overwhelmed and anxious now there is a lot of people feeling a lot of feelings about this I've seen tons of people rooting for her feeling like this is his karma for using her voice without her permission some people are saying that she's just money hungry he's famous now she wants to make money and you know she wants some of his but I don't know I feel like you know she's a lawyer she went to law school he used her voice without her permission like he knows that she declined the offer and of course she's wanting a piece of the pie like since he did go ahead and use it she was also there in the early days watching him come up I mean according to reports back when they were together she was in charge of his scheduling invoices contracts so this is probably all also her coming for a check for all of those times that she helped him rise to fame and he did kind of give her something to sue him over since that is her voice and I mean two thousand dollars that original offer didn't sound too good granted that he's made millions of dollars off of that album and those individual songs so 40 million dollars that is a lot of money and some people are trying to calculate how much she would actually probably get after lawyers fees and negotiations some people are thinking she'll probably land somewhere in 10 million I don't know who knows if this will actually like go through and she'll win but I mean there's a good amount of people that are rooting for her even though there are people that are like she shouldn't get anything I mean at this point those songs individually have millions of views on YouTube one has 355 million views on YouTube and more than 235 million Spotify streams the other one has more than 60 million views on YouTube and 280 million streams on Spotify okay these are huge numbers and so many ears that have heard her voice and I'm just gonna say that obviously if she's a lawyer she knows when is the right time to sue someone and I don't think that she would be doing this if she felt like she was going to lose or if she felt like it wasn't actually something that she could like stand on I don't know and she has to feel strongly about it if she's going to come after a bad bunny because he obviously has a lot of people that love him and that support him and to go against that is is really hard sometimes so the fact that she's standing up for herself that's that's pretty big I feel like the situation would be very different if when his team called her up she was like yeah for sure use my voice in your song and then was like oh I want to sue because I should actually be getting paid for that but since she said no when they called her and they went ahead and used it anyway I just feel like she's in the right here you know like what'd you guys think that she was gonna do like not be upset but people are also taking this as a big time to joke about him and the Kardashians and that curse some people are even joking like him Kardashian is about to like represent him in court and in regards to that curse people are saying that something like this would happen to him after associating with his family thank you so I called the Kardashian curse in one of my first videos when it was confirmed that they were dating and people were telling me I was wrong because she's a Jenner but I think it applies to all of them because they're sisters I don't subscribe to this idea that this group of women are cursed I don't subscribe to that idea but if you do subscribe to the idea that maybe the Kardashians are cursed Bad Bunny is getting sued not only is he getting so that's not funny Bad Bunny and rima's entertainment or being sued by Carly's De La Cruz Benito's ex-girlfriend I think this is definitely a mess but maybe something that he should have seen coming by using the audio and maybe he did maybe he's not even mad that this is happening some people are even trying to like theorize that he did this on purpose because he wanted to be able to give her this money for helping him in his career all this time and he knew that she wouldn't accept the money so he wanted to you know give her away to I was like what this story is getting crazier and Crazier by the minute but either way I hope she gets that money because that's her voice and I feel like it's deserved but like I said there's a lot of opinions going on there so some people might think that maybe she doesn't maybe some people will think that she's money hungry a bunch of stuff there's a lot of opinions going on I will say though that in terms of the part of the lawsuit that she talks about social media and how people associate her with Bad Bunny baby it is true she has her Instagram comments turned off and I can only imagine and that it is because that might have been the only comments that she was getting there for a while and I'm also so sure that with his lawsuit people would even try to comment that even more especially people that are upset at her pursuing him so I can imagine it being annoying if you said that you did not want this line to be in the song using your voice and then everybody knows and then everyone's commenting about it especially if you didn't want it like it's one thing if you did but if you didn't that's like a whole other thing because when she originally recorded it he wasn't bad bunny like he wasn't headlining coach hella bad Bunny and she didn't agree for it to be on this album all these years later when he was bad bunny but that's what's going on with Bad Bunny I certainly want to know what you guys think about all of this do you guys think this is all because of that Dane Kardashian curse that this is all happening to him do you guys think that she has a right to sue and get this money what are your thoughts on the situation let me know in the comments below I love you guys so so much and I'll talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music] thank you 
02/24/2023,Sam Smith HECKLED by Stranger for Being DEMONIC?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-eTkCfm4cA,101-18,Sam Smith just got heckled in the streets of New York for not only being queer and happy but for also promoting Satanism to his younger audience the main question is when did this hate train towards Sam Smith all begin and why are people now throwing dirt on Sam's name for no reason despite them being confident and open about their true identity we're gonna address all the answers to these questions shortly but first let's go back to 2019 where it all started in case you guys didn't know Sam Smith's career goes all the way back to 2012 when they started performing as a child and scored their first hit to a song called Latch but their press coverage came in 2009 when Sam's mother a banker making over 500 000 pounds a year sued her employer after being fired and instead of Sam's mother using the money for herself she decided to promote Sam's pop career while at the office two years later Sam began working extra hard on music in which they released their first debut album in the Lonely Hour in May 2014 and y'all this album featured tons of hit singles such as stay with me I'm not the only one like I can and la la all of these four singles gained more than 10 billion streams you guys including YouTube views and honestly this was the moment where people saw something in Sam a year later Sam proceeded to release a song for the James Bond movie Specter called writings on the wall which also broke tons of records as well and y'all at this point in time people were really obsessing over Sam despite how they came out as gay publicly in 2014 after they acknowledged a two-month-long relationship with the actor and model Jonathan zizel yeah for some reason not that many people were bothered about Sam's sexuality especially after they dropped another album in 2017 and released a music video for the single too good at goodbyes that represented the lgbtq plus Community but then things took a huge turn for Sam's career once they decided to come come out as non-binary in September 2019 Sam shared an Instagram post announcing that they will be changing their pronouns to they them and this came after Sam decided to embrace themselves after being at war with their gender today is a good day so here goes I've decided I am changing my pronouns to they them after a lifetime of being at war with my gender I've decided to embrace myself for who I am inside and out I am so excited and privileged to be surrounded by people that support me in this decision but I've been very nervous about announcing this because I care too much about what people think but yeah I understand there will be many mistakes and misgendering but all I ask is you please please try I hope you can see me like I see myself now thank you ever since Sam came out as non-binary they have been very supportive and open about donating to multiple lgbtq plus Charities and organizations in fact they even launched their own charity aimed at helping young homosexuals to come out to their friends and family as sweet as this was unfortunately the general public was upset and disgusted by Sam's decision as not only did they find it weird how Sam came out suddenly as non-binary but they even couldn't accept the idea to call Sam by their current pronouns as they were used to their old pronouns which were he him this made Sam support the non-binary and trans Community even more in fact Sam also became confident with who they were after they began posting pictures of themselves half naked to support body positivity for their Audience by the way I keep this topic in mind because we're going to address it later in the video but at that time you guys the majority of people were being supportive of Sam's decision and as a result of that Sam decided to release another album in 2020 that opened up about their Journey with self-discovery and acceptance now here's where the hate train towards Sam All Began because after they dropped an album and went on a break for a couple of years Sam returned with a new snippet of their song called Unholy that featured Kim Petras foreign [Music] [Laughter] immediately on Tick Tock after millions and millions of people began posting about it and asking Sam to release it officially for some reason Sam decided to delay the release of the song which threw a lot of people off especially after they demanded the song for a while and it got to the point where the song became annoying before it even dropped after Sam decided to post millions of videos promoting the song with the same snippet yeah guys one video that gained a lot of attention on social media was a clip of Sam promoting the song In the Streets of London after a resident found them awkwardly filming a tick tock for it under her apartment A lot of people clowned Sam Smith on social media because of this video but thankfully a month and a half later Sam finally released the song officially with Kim on streaming platforms and despite the hatred towards the song already it actually charted at number one on the billboard hot 100. following the release of this song Sam and Kim performed their collab for their fans multiple times at different festivals and concerts and as a result of that people decided to Bully Sam and Kim for entertainment after they made a meme out of the clip of the audience screaming in Terror at Sam and Kim's performance a couple of weeks later people began a huge hate campaign towards Sam on social media after they started body shaming them for sharing multiple pictures on social media of them wearing bathing suits and being comfortable with their skin and keep in mind this hatred towards Sam's body just came recently as people were fully supportive of them posting body pictures years ago on social media it's weird to think about not gonna lie but following the body shaming comments that Sam received they decided to piss millions of people off a month later after they released a music video for the new single I'm not here to make friends and somehow a lot of people found the music video very disturbing after they went on Twitter to point out how Sam was promoting photography and sexual activities to their younger audience after this Sam released their highly anticipated album Gloria which debuted at number seven on the billboard 200 and a couple of days later they attended the Grammys with Kim to perform their hit single Unholy and wore all red on the red carpet now we all know what happened afterwards at the Grammys because not only did Sam and Kim win a Grammy for their song but they also lost millions of fans and followers as well after they both performed on stage wearing a devil costume you can find more details on this situation in my previous video about Sam but this situation you guys annoyed millions of people especially parents and more conservative people who went on social media to call Sam Smith out for promoting Satanism and having a demonic ritual on stage a couple of days later after Sam began trending because of this topic Sam decided to take advantage of the hateful comments towards them by posting more pictures of their body on social media platforms and yet again people fell for it and started body shaming them on media platforms for absolutely no reason at this point the hate towards Sam was being forced and pushed by so many people for no reason and it seems that Sam was smartly using this opportunity to promote their album and their single Unholy by Annoying a lot of people with their presence but unfortunately this situation took a huge turn this week once Sam got heckled by an elderly woman in public after he got called demonic bastard and a pedophile in the streets of New York you belong in hell sorry for longer than hell you're demonic twisted sick bastard leave the kids alone you're sick first record Sam Smith after this clip went viral you guys tons of people went on social media to support Sam out of nowhere from all the hate they have been receiving especially after they got attacked by this Karen who had no business embarrassing them in public with stupid accusations I hope Sam Smith is surrounded by a loving and supportive group of people being openly loudly and visibly queer comes with so much and they don't deserve this mess Sam has been getting a lot of from all sides including the people who are supposed to be in the community with them I hope they're okay oh this sick Behavior you don't have to like what they do and how they dress but this is a hate crime how can you all still be comfortable with joking about Sam Smith when this is the kind of vital they receive daily anyways loves make sure

02/09/2023,Sam Smith SATANIC Performance is TERRIFYING People...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMobrXbVLV8,95-18,y'all the 2023 Grammy Awards just went down a couple of days ago and let me just say it was messy as well I mean since when were the Grammys so messy we all know how fans have gone crazy once their favorite artists get snubbed and this is here you guys things went completely out of hand after many celebrities got upset about losing their Awards to other artists and as a result some of the winners became a target of slander and hate to the point where they got bullied by millions of people online just for taking a Grammy award home Sam Smith was one of the Hot Topics this year at the Grammys after they got involved in a huge controversy over their performance and in case you guys didn't know Sam Actually attended the Grammys this year with Kim Petras to perform their hit single Unholy which was nominated for best duo slash group performance but here's where it gets crazy a day before Sam performed their song Unholy at the Grammys they stated that their performance will be over the top and that it will upset a lot of Christians and even though it was highly expected from Sam people were surprised to see that they wore a devil costume during their performance while Kim scaled a large cage in a matching outfit this situation you guys pissed millions of people off especially parents who went on social media and had organic panic over Sam and Kim's performance for the people still wondering why we have a problem with Sam Smith pushing the degenerate and satanic Hollywood agenda we don't want dark nasty energy like this influencing our children WTF is this all about Sam Smith I guess it's part of the sold my soul deal that these Psychopaths make this is some Illuminati double worshiping [ __ ] at the Grammys that Sam Smith prick he needs to be put down despite the hate towards them Sam and Kim ended up winning a Grammy for their song after they won best duo group performance award category and y'all even Kim Petras made history with being the first ever transgender women to win a Grammy award unfortunately this wasn't the only controversy that went down this year after Harry Styles got booed off the stage for winning album of the Year be honest who would have thought that Harry Styles would get dragged the second he stepped on the Grammy's red carpet I mean we all know his outfits are quite questionable sometimes but for some reason a lot of people were upset that Harry Style showed up at the Grammys looking like that after they started calling him a clown and a queer baiter on social media looks like someone's drunk homeless Uncle who works part-time as a clown he's not breaking any gender roles he's only hurting our eyes he needs to stop innovating if you thought things couldn't get any worse well unfortunately it did after Harry had technical difficulties while performing his song as it was and not gonna lie Harry seemed pretty pissed at how everything went horribly wrong during his performance oh anyways on a good note Harry did get nominated with other huge contenders such as Beyonce and Adele for album of the year and somehow you guys here I managed to take the award home after his album Harry's house won a Grammy for album of the Year this situation did not only upset millions of fans worldwide but it even upset Adele herself who was seen unhappy once the presenter announced Harry as a winner thank you yeah you can tell that she was very disappointed based on her reaction but a lot of people are pointing out that Adele probably wanted Beyonce to take the award home hence why she reacted this way nevertheless this wasn't the biggest issue about the situation because the momentary stepped on stage to accept the award many people in the audience started booing Harry and telling him to get off the stage and y'all they were even yelling to Harry that Beyonce should have won the award instead for her album [Music] a lot of people took to Twitter to point out how rude and disrespectful it was for the audience to yell at Harry as if he was the person who was responsible for choosing to win the award that's childish as hell regardless of who you believe should have won to take away from someone's moment of accomplishment is such a rude nasty way it is completely unacceptable sorry but booing or not clapping for a winner regardless of whether you thought they should have won is just so unprofessional and Petty and just rude you don't need to be a fan of him but this is just straight up mean learn some basic human decency didn't Beyonce literally win more Awards than anyone here he has like two y'all gotta share anyways speaking of Beyonce she did actually win the most Grammy Awards this year after she broke the record for the most wins of all time which is 32 Grammys and as a result of that Beyonce delivered a very emotional speech while accepting the award you can tell that this accomplishment meant so much to Beyonce and she did seem very grateful standing on stage while accepting her 30-second award although one of her collaborators Diplo was caught mouthing they bought that as Beyonce was accepting the award which started a lot of speculation on social media about whether Beyonce bought her Grammy Award or not yeah we still have no idea if this is true or not but some people believe that Diplo mouthed I'm part of that since he worked with Beyonce on her album and statistically he would get a Grammy award for it as well now let's move on to cute and funny moments that happened at the Grammys because Adele was surprised by Dwayne Johnson AKA The Rock after she revealed in multiple interviews that she has always wanted to meet him and y'all just take a look at how cute this interaction was Adele also had a very awkward and confusing reaction at the Grammys after the presenter decided to welcome sza on stage with a very descriptive intro about her and y'all just take a look at how confused Adele was album SOS it's been number one on the shots seven weeks and Counting and just think this is a woman who almost became a marine biologist and if she had there would be no theme song for killing your ex please welcome scissor speaking of celebrity reactions the internet also highlighted a very awkward clip of Doja cat after she seemed hella pissed at the Grammys for giving the award to Sam Smith and Kim Petras and her if you thought this was awkward well here's a video of the audience reacting to a random artist winning song of the year after so many people expected it to go to one of the big nominations such as Harry Styles Beyonce Adele or Taylor Swift just like that [Applause] anyways loves I hope you enjoyed this short recap of the

02/09/2023,Miley Cyrus Finally EXPOSES The Truth On Liam Hemsworth Cheating...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftbQbzAGPqk,94-16,imagine how embarrassing it is for Liam Hemsworth to watch his ex Smiley break tons of records off of a new Shady song about him I would have deleted my social media and traveled to a deserted island if you thought Shakira was the only one who was beefing with her ex this month while Miley Cyrus also did not hesitate to drag her ex-husband in a new song after she shared tons of Easter eggs in her new music video that left millions of her fans speechless but before we get into all the details about the situation let's go back and talk about Miley and Liam's relationship and how they ended up being enemies after dating for almost a decade if you guys didn't know Miley and Liam had one of the most complicated relationships ever in Hollywood in fact their relationship goes all the way back to 2009 when Miley and Liam met on the set of the last song the movie adaptation of the popular Nicholas Sparks novel and shortly after filming wrapped the two confirmed their Roman ants after they were caught making out at an airport unfortunately their relationship didn't go smoothly at first after Liam's representative confirmed in August 2010 that he and Miley had split after months of breakup rumors and y'all at that same time both Miley and Liam were gone separate ways until they got back together a month later a lot of fans were confused about Liam and Miley's relationship and whether they had actually broken up or not but they were seen sharing cuddles and kisses while having dinner in California which allegedly confirmed their relationship on November 2010 Miley and Liam broke up again after sources revealed that their on and off-again relationship was off and that people never know with Miley and Liam and they could be back on at some point even though you might think that their fans had given up surprisingly a lot of them were actually supportive at that time and they had high hopes that Miley and Liam would return to each other at some point until they actually did in May 2012 when Miley and Liam suddenly announced their engagement yeah after the careers as in on again off-again couple Liam proposed to Miley with a 3.5 carat ring from Neil Wayne and y'all this came after the couple revealed that Liam had spent a lot of time with Miley's family and they approve of their relationship together in March 2013 tons of breakup rumors started swirling around the couple after Miley was seen going out in public with her ring off but that did not stop Miley from speaking out about the rumors after she went on Twitter and insisted that she did not end her engagement to Liam I am so sick of LA and sick of the lies that come with it I didn't call off my wedding taking a break from social media hashtag draining even though Miley confirmed that she and Liam didn't break up people still speculated about their relationship after the couple postponed their wedding when they were intended to marry in the summer and guess what it turned out that the couple had already broken up after they called off their engagement on September 13 2013. following their breakup tons of controversies started going around about Liam after he was spotted locking lips with the Mexican singer Isa Gonzalez days after the split and y'all even Miley Cyrus was rumored to be hanging around with Benji Madden after she was caught making out with him at a Halloween party everything was going fine with Miley and Liam throughout 2013 to 2016 after they both got into multiple relationships with celebs and people and y'all they even spoke to magazines about how they will always have love for each other even if they weren't on good terms at that moment this situation made many fans wonder whether there was a chance that Miley and Liam could get back together or not until rumors started floating around that Miley and Liam were back together yeah in January of 2016 Miley and Liam were spotted canoodling and kissing at a music festival after multiple fans witnessed the situation and exposed it on social media and thankfully it did not take ages this time for the couple to announce their relationship again after Miley went on Instagram and posted a picture showing her wearing her engagement ring again despite how Liam and Miley had kept going back and forth with their relationship they actually took it very seriously this time after they stayed together until 2019 but in the meantime Miley was spending her time with Liam in Australia to visit his parents and Liam also spent the majority of his time with Miley's family as well after they shared pictures together and honestly everything was going completely differently this time I mean Miley seemed very happy with her relationship with Liam after she shared a picture of them welcoming 2017 together and y'all they even posted cute birthday pictures for each other on Instagram as well in December 2018 Miley revealed that she and Liam Hemsworth got married after she confirmed that they tied the knot three days earlier in an Instagram post and as sweet as this was the couple did not last more than a year together after they separated eight months later for unknown reasons and filed for a divorce and after a year they settled the divorce and finalized it on February 22nd 2020. of course the internet was thriving once all this was going down since they were sharing controversial videos of I'm trying to control and tame Miley on the red carpet just to throw hate at him but at the same time Miley was going through a lot during her breakup with Liam after she revealed in multiple interviews that she wasn't herself throughout her relationship with him and she felt so controlled by him to the point where she felt she had to be a mom of the house and wasn't the type of person to be so other than this Miley even released a song later on called slide away where she allegedly opened up about how Liam used to consume pills and alcohol while they were dating and how she didn't want to be a part of their relationship anymore forward to this year you guys Miley decided to release her first single flowers from her new album that will be dropping on March 10th and immediately you guys people noticed that Miley released her single on the same day that Liam was born which was January 13th this could be a coincidence but trust me it gets even better because in her new song flowers Miley referenced her old Malibu house with Liam that they used to live in before it got ravaged by California wildfires and y'all this is what she had to say we were good we were gold kind of dream that can't be sold we were right till we weren't built a home and watched it burn while we can't find a confirmed report many outlets claim that Liam once dedicated Bruno Mars's song When I Was Your Man to Miley which is relevant because her lyrics and her new single flowers seem to respond directly to that song's lyrics just stop the video and look at the comparison another link Miley's fans are making to her ex-husband is the suit that she wore in the music video of course it wasn't exactly the same suit but her outfit in the music video was somewhat similar to what Liam wore on The Avengers endgame Premiere red carpet in 2019. aka the same red carpet when a video went viral of him telling her could you behave for once when she pretended to lick him again these are only speculations going around about Miley's new song flowers and the fact that it broke so many records is actually insane because it became the fastest song to reach 100 million streams in Spotify history and y'all it even debuted and number one on the Billboard Hot 100 with 425k sales it's honestly shocking how Miley is still thriving and breaking records 17 years into her career but all the controversies that went around about this song made a lot of people curious whether Miley had intended to shade her ex-husband or not until her sister Brandy Cyrus spoke up about the rumors going around flowers being a response to Liam by saying this but it's so great it's the best PR that could ever happen because it gets people talking about the song and Tick Tock and it's everywhere and it's just so fun to watch it all play out Miley fans I love you is any of it true I'm not here to say oh come on no I'm not you don't have to say which ones are true I'm letting this play out no you don't have to say which ones are true you just need to tell me if some of them are true I don't know come on think you have to it's a first-hand experience situation only Miley knows the truth anyway in this video I do want to point out that Liam Hemsworth is currently getting called out for allegedly dating Miley's ex-backup dancer and before anyone comes after me the rumor is still not confirmed but a lot of fans think that this was Liam's response to Miley's new song about him anyways loves if you enjoyed today's video then make sure to hit that like button and click on the tab for more juicy videos 
01/27/2022,Selena Gomez FORCED To Breakup With New BF?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ3ERknHieQ,93-14,people are now trying to control Selena Gomez's relationships again after she sparked dating rumors with Drew tagger of The Chainsmokers and y'all some of them are even forcing her to break up it's not even a joke aside from Selena Gomez getting criticized on the internet for her new relationship Kim Kardashian also got canceled by the entire internet this week after she purchased another celebrity's iconic item and this time it was Princess Diana's diamond necklace I know we're gonna get into all of the details in just a second but for now let's talk about Selena Gomez and how she ended up getting criticized again this week it hasn't been a month since Selena Gomez was body shamed on social media after some Paparazzi pictures of her went viral and y'all guess what she's getting dragged again after she sparked dating rumors with a new artist as you all know Selena's relationships haven't been the best in the last couple of years in fact her past relationships with Justin Bieber left her with tons of trauma end issues not because of Justin specifically but because of the general public bullying her into taking Justin back thankfully Selena was able to talk about the emotional abuse she received from the internet in her recent documentary after she shared how hard it was for her to deal with the hate and drama from Justin's fanbase and how impossible it was for her to go in public without the paparazzi following her and asking her about Justin it just sucks I have no idea what the [ __ ] I'm doing the pressure is just overwhelming because I want to do the best I can the whole song thing he called me this morning about this song with Justin and I was like when am I gonna just be good enough by myself this was eye-opening for so many people especially those who bullied Selena throughout the years because of her relationships but of course this did not stop Selena from opening her heart again to other guys after she dated the DJ Zed Niall Horan Charlie puth and The Weeknd Selena's last public relationship with the weekend ended after 10 months of dating and since then Selena has been very discreet about her relationships with men especially those who have a big following but back in 2021 Selena sparked dating rumors with a cast member of her show how to get away with murder called Aaron Dominguez and to this day the rumor hasn't been confirmed yet even though Selena might have managed to keep her alleged relationship with Aaron a secret she failed this time to keep her new love interest private after she was caught hanging out with the artist drew Taggart from The Chainsmokers if you guys don't know The Chainsmokers well they're an American electronic DJ and production duo consisting of Alex Powell and Drew tagger and they both went viral a couple of years after they released multiple songs that blew up worldwide unfortunately the majority of people have forgotten about The Chainsmokers AKA Alex and Drew but they recently made a very controversial comment in their recent interview that got a lot of people talking after they both revealed they've had three sums with multiple fans in the past how often do people propose threesomes with the two of you and how often have you accepted how often is it proposed not proposed to sell them yeah yeah but it's a lot of man what has happened does it count if it's internationally people were heavily disgusted and disturbed by the comments that Alex and Drew made in the in fact majority of the people on the internet criticized them and started talking about how fans should have left them back in 2017 but this all took a shocking turn just one week later after the news Outlet US Weekly reported that Selena Gomez and a member of The Chainsmokers Drew Taggart were officially dating of course no one believed the news at first since there wasn't really any solid evidence that Selena was in a relationship with Drew but that was until a random Paparazzi caught both Selena Andrew on a bowling date a week later the amount of hate comments Selena received over this news was insane since so many fans felt that Drew was a huge downgrade for her and that she shouldn't be around people like him especially after what he revealed in his recent interview get the brother away from her we know what they did with fans free her from those chains that's like falling into Justin Bieber's long-lost cousin Selena look at me honey this isn't you after reading the threesome news she better get herself checked for chlamydia Selena is has got to be your biggest downgrade after both Selena Andrews started trending on social media over this situation Selena took to Instagram to debunk all the rumors Days Later by announcing that she's single and she likes being alone way too much I like being alone way too much hashtag I am single it's funny how artists are announcing that they're single nowadays just to debunk relationship rumors but surprisingly this announcement didn't age well for both Selena Andrew after they got caught leaving a restaurant together while holding hands at this point fans were hella confused about Selena's relationship status and whether she was actually dating Drew or not but from what it seems you guys Selena is trying her best to keep her relationship private with Drew at the moment hence why she announced that she's single just to keep her relationship away from the spotlight anyways loves let's move on now to Kim Kardashian who decided to disrespect herself and other dead celebrities for trying to own their item again can anyone for the love of God stop Kim Kardashian from obsessing over old items from influential people it's getting ridiculous at this point if you guys have seen my previous videos on Kim back in 2022 then you probably know the mess that went down with her ever since she decided to go to the Met Gala wearing Marilyn Monroe's iconic dress for some reason people were hella upset that Kim borrowed Marilyn Monroe's original dress for the Met Gala only for her to destroy the dress hours later after the company that owned the dressed posted pictures of it as a result of this Kim received tons of backlash on social media for having access to a dead celebrity's clothes and destroying Marilyn Monroe's iconic dress and y'all the worst part about it is that Kim also got gifted a jar of Marilyn Monroe's real hair and just imagine the things that people had to say about her afterwards because not only was she getting dragged for being privileged enough to disrespect the dead and own pieces of their items but she was getting criticized for being ungrateful by pulling these stunts just for attention what is this oh my God I'm literally going to do some crazy Voodoo [ __ ] and I Channel her a couple of months later Kim got attacked again on social media after she announced on her Instagram stories that her daughter North got gifted with Michael Jackson's original jacket that he had wore for his Smooth Criminal music video and y'all people on the internet went insane over this situation since they found it disrespectful that North had the right to own a legendary piece of Michael when his kids have been begging for years to get his stuff now you might be thinking that Kim might have learned her lesson by now after she got dragged multiple times last year for trying to collect iconic fashion pieces but unfortunately this woman made it worse this week after she decided to purchase Princess Diana's famous diamond cross necklace yeah Princess Diana according to TMZ you guys Kim was able to snatch that rare diamond encrusted necklace at Sotheby's auction after she bid on it for 197k and purchased it in immediately so in my opinion I feel like the blame should have been put on the person who sold it instead of Kim since she bought this one herself but surprisingly tons of other people disagreed with this situation after Kim started trending on Twitter with thousands of people attacking her for going after dead people's possessions again I feel like these things shouldn't even be up for sale they need to be given to her family or Harry like why are they just willingly giving her stuff away I swear to God she better not wear it it's a

01/20/2023,Why HyunA Need To Be Cancelled,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb1EIzIgXNg,111-14,Gianna is a very controversial artist Idol along with other artists like kyolin and Jesse but why well you see South Korea in general adores cute Concepts like twice red velvet pristine Etc Hannah though is more on the scandalous side and on the revealing side which is usually frowned upon however some people actually love this side of her since she shows the reality of becoming a mature woman many also love Hannah for her unusual fashion choices and styling but this time it seems that she might have gone a little bit too far in her recent post on Instagram which was posted a few days ago by the way Kiana shared a series of photos of herself in her usually eclectic Style with a cute short haircut although fans enjoyed the first couple of photos it was the last one that caused controversy in the picture Hannah is seen walking away from the camera in a way that allows the back she's wearing to be seen the bag is a statement piece that looks like a pink Rave bear with harnesses goggles and other unusual accessories I guess it's cute right but when you look at the comments on the post they are overwhelmingly about the pink bag fans showed their criticism and disappointment in Jana's ownership of it some of the comments under her post read girl not the bag not this bag please delete not this bag please we love you don't do that but what is it about this bag that many are disappointed in well it takes us back to the recent Valencia AGA controversy at first many people thought this bag was the Balenciaga bondage slash BDSM bear backpack which recently came under Fire for using children in the promotional photos for the accessory to be fair Balenciaga has been known for its seemingly intentionally controversial marketing and design choices still this one was particularly in poor taste and it was extremely poorly received because of the children involved in what is considered a mature item the brand even issued an apology for the criticized promotional photos but that hasn't kept many people from still deciding to boycott the brand however the bag that Shanna is seen wearing is not part of the Balenciaga BDSM bear bag line or even an item from the brand at all it's actually from the brand doll's kill as seen on the company's website but this still didn't stop the flood of criticizing comments but why it turns out doll's kill also has a fair share of its own controversies starting from stealing artwork from other artists to racist behavior and even some very questionable t-shirt designs doll skill has done it all as a result many people have boycotted the brand well seems reasonable enough to me some of the people commenting on Hannah's posts already knew that the bag is from doll's kill but that still didn't stop their disappointment seeing the K-pop Idol supporting them since the brand is still pretty problematic but if the brand is under such controversy why is Tiana going out of her way to promote its products I don't know about you guys but as an artist and a person of influence I don't think Kiana should be presenting the brand it is an insult to all the people who were wronged by dolls kill but guess what this isn't the first time she has worn the brand oh and it gets worse she is also not the only K-pop Idol that has included doll's kill in their outfits groups like itsy and twice have also worn different items from this brand in their recent promotions this brand is actually pretty common among female K-pop Idols in particular wow this is just not right you guys especially for Hannah because she is known to be an artist who speaks and stands up for for what they believe in starting from her four minute days and throughout her solo career Jana has been someone with an unrivaled voice she is also a role model to many young Idols who are growing up and dreaming to be like her and seeing a person in her position affiliated with a brand that is said to be racist and anti-feminist that's just not okay you guys although some people tried to defend her by saying that she was given the product by her stylists others were seen arguing what the probability of her having no idea about the whole situation would be while sharing a clear picture of the bag it's been a few days since hyena shared the picture and there haven't been any apologies from her or her agency to clear up the controversy or explain her side of the story what do you guys think of the situation do you think Kiana should apologize for representing such a brand on her Instagram or are people just overreacting let me know what you guys think in the comment section and don't forget to subscribe foreign [Music] 
01/12/2022,Selena Gomez Opens Up On People Bodyshaming Her..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tTnd3JjM5Y,85-16,we're only one week into 2023 and people are already getting on my nerves again because why the hell are we body shaming Selena Gomez now some of y'all need serious help aside from Selena Gomez getting body shamed by the entire internet Taylor Swift and sizza also got into a fight after Taylor decided to block sizza from getting a number one album and y'all even Bad Bunny got canceled on social media after he got caught in multiple videos being rude to fans and snatching their phones I wish I was joking with that being said let's go ahead and address the first issue surrounding Selena Gomez and people body shaping her you know it's funny how some people preach about body positivity daily on social media and to have those treat people with kindness quotes on their bio but then they go on their way to fully a celebrity the next day just for entertainment make it make sense as we all know Selena Gomez has been a huge top topic of conversation over the last five months ever since her documentary came out since then people have been trying to start rumors about her being rude to her own friends While others made fun of her mental illnesses and accused Selena of trying to gain Sympathy for the media of course a lot of people took sides with Selena in this situation and defended her While others attacked her mostly because of how she became friends with Haley Bieber all of a sudden who has been a huge enemy to Selena for years if you guys missed my previous video on Selena basically Selena had to remove over an hour and a half of footage from her documentary that focused on her past relationship with Justin Bieber and this Behavior annoyed millions of people on social media as they were all anticipating the full truth about their toxic relationship and how it ended up leaving an impact on this generation all this hate towards Selena you guys ended up piling up this week when Selena was photographed by a Paparazzi while she was on vacation in Mexico and y'all the amount of hate comments Selena received on these pictures was insane I mean not only about people bullying her for getting sicker but they were also body shaming her and trying to make fun of her weight by saying that she has been eating way too much just take a look at some of these comments oh she's huge the pop girly who's aging the worst I fear it's time to put the hot dogs Down Selena she needs to hit the gym instead of being obsessed over pretty models yeah imagine how pathetic it is to pick on a celebrity for their weight just to gain some clout and responses on social media but I'm glad Selena handled it the right way and avoided responding to the hate comments anyways let's move on now to Bad Bunny who received tons of backlash right now after he got accused twice of being rude to his own fans not gonna lie to you guys the news about Bad Bunny this week shook me a bit because despite the successful years Bad Bunny had in 2021 and 2022 I never expected him one day to get canceled for being rude to his own fans as we all know Bad Bunny is one of the biggest and most successful artists on Earth in fact he was the most talked about artists in 2022 after he launched his own tour and grossed over 435 million dollars which is the most of any tour in recorded history other than that he even earned the biggest streaming year for any artist in Spotify history with over 20 billion streams just in one year can you imagine I mean it's crazy to think about all of his achievements especially where he came from before his Fame and success but unfortunately this all changed this week once a video of Bad Bunny in public went viral where he seemed to be throwing a Fan's phone in the water after they violated his personal space check this out [Music] I know that wow of course the amount of hate comments Bad Bunny received for his actions was insane as many people attacked him for acting recklessly and being so full of himself when he should have asked the fan to just give him space instead despite all that bad bunny issued a response on Twitter about the situation the next day and let me just say it disappointed tons of people here's what he said the person who comes up to me to say hello to tell me something or just to meet me will always receive my attention and respect those who come to put a phone in my face I will consider it for what it is a lack of respect and I will treat it like one for an unknown reason Bad Bunny deleted his response to the situation a couple of hours later and to be honest I kind of wish that he had kept his response up considering how he got involved in another incident the next day where he got caught snatching another Fan's phone at a club in the Dominican Republic see if bat bunny were to keep his response up he would have been dragged on social media for his hypocrisy because it was a clear as Crystal that this fan at a club didn't invade bad Bunny's personal space whatsoever and for him to snatch this Fan's phone while the fan wasn't even recording him is kind of wrong and immature can't defend him this time let me not lie even if it was Beyonce there shouldn't be a reason when you take someone's personal things and literally break them this is getting so boring just because you're famous doesn't mean you have the right to steal people's phones y'all need to stop supporting him his head getting too big but let's just end today's video with sizza and Taylor Swift getting into a fight and beefing over a number one album we all know by now how both sizza and Taylor Swift released one of the best albums in late 2022. of course Taylor Swift broke tons of records with her album midnights after she took over the entire Billboard Hot 100 with her songs and received the biggest streaming year by a female artist in Spotify history with 13.9 billion streams the same goes for sizza as well she released her most anticipated album this year called SOS after five years and this album was the most talked about album this year after it went viral on social media and became the first r b album by a female artist to spend its first three weeks on the billboard 200. now here's where the drama started between sza and Taylor Swift because as you all know Taylor has been getting called chart obsessed and a scammer for releasing multiple versions of her song anti-hero just to keep it stable at number one on the billboard hot 100. and with this decision being made she blocked both Drake and Rihanna from getting a number one song on the Billboard Hot 100 and at this point she even blocked Mariah Carey from getting a number one as well for her song All I Want for Christmas but thankfully it went number one a month later people thought that Taylor releasing multiple versions for one song to keep it at number one was a total scam but this issue this week was a bit different after Taylor decided to release four digital versions of her album Midnight on her website to make her album reach number one again and y'all this made millions of people attack Taylor for being greedy especially after how sizza's album was going at number one for four weeks straight of course with fans dragging the situation far on social media Susan and her team had to come up with a solution to block Taylor for plating Shady games and getting number one after they decided to release digital exclusives on sza's website as a response and y'all even scissors manager went on Twitter and said this despicable tactics LOL ended Taylor Swift SOS by sza becomes the first r b album by a woman to spend its first four weeks at number one on the billboard 200 since Janet by Janet Jackson in 1993. lol after both sizza and Taylor started trending on social media over this drama sizza decided to go on Twitter to clear up their Rumors by defending Taylor after she clarified that she wasn't competing with her and that she was only trying her best uh I feel silly that I even have to say this but I see supporters arguing and I hate that I don't have beef with anyone especially not Taylor LMAO I genuinely loved her album and all the writing everyone's just trying to do their best as we all should love to everyone good night with Taylor giving zero response towards the situation surprisingly since his album surpassed Taylor and remained number one on the billboard 200 for four weeks straight and of course people had some words to say about the entire situation check this out imagine pausing your rehearsals selling 37 second audio clips for five dollars and making several remixes of a song just to lose Taylor and her 300 remixes failed I'm crying it's kind of insane that sizza have to make this tweet while Taylor Swift sees her fandom drag other artists all the time for absolutely no reason and has never done or said anything about it anyways loves make sure to click

01/03/2023,The Bad Bunny Situation..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHIzE1h-zDk,109-12,Bad Bunny just hit back at a fan who he claims had gotten into his personal space and the way he hit back at her is causing a huge uproar on social media you guys on Monday January 2nd the day after New Year's Bad Bunny was seen walking down the streets of Dominican Republic and he ended up having a crowd of his fans formulate pretty quick of course with someone of a big name in the music industry like Bad Bunny I think it's safe to say that these celebrities have almost little to no privacy when it comes to stepping out and that's exactly what ended up happening with Bad Bunny this week but some think the invasion of privacy went a little too far as Bad Bunny was seen walking down the streets and many of his fans swarmed around him to get a closer look and meet him in person one girl did something that that bunny thought was completely off the grid and what Bad Bunny did in response to this girl getting up all in his face with her phone has created a lot of mixed reactions on social yeah and Bad Bunny has even come forward to speak out about those so if you guys were wondering why this video clip has gotten pretty controversial especially over on Twitter to the point where not only Bad Bunny started trending but this clip has gotten over a million views in just a couple of hours well it's because of bad Bunny's response to the way he ended up dealing with a fan who is invading his personal space let's just say he decided to grab her phone and throw it in the water yeah he completely tossed the girl's phone and you can also see the shocked look on the Fan's face as she comes to realization with what just happened foreign [Music] [Music] and I'm sure she wasn't expecting that at all but I guess it was only a matter of time for a Bad Bunny to stand his ground and stick up for his personal space at least that's what he claimed to have done now from what it looks like in the video it seemed like the girl whose phone was thrown down the Water by Bad Bunny seemed to initially be attempting to get a selfie off of Bad Bunny but others think she was holding her phone in front of the rapper for just way too long just screaming and yelling as he's simply trying to just make his way home to which other is Justified that what bad bunny did was okay because at that point it seemed like the fan was just disrespecting Bad Bunny and not taking into account his personal space at all some are saying that at the end of the day he's human he might have just had a long day and that it just wasn't necessary for the girl to have the phone all up in his face while simultaneously yelling like that and that it was just a matter of time for a Bad Bunny to do something about it but others on the other hand think that what bad bunny did was discuss testing and just take a look at what many people have been having to say about this there's been a whole debate over on Twitter with some saying what makes celebs think they can act like this this sucks because I feel like it could have definitely been handled differently and those men around him isn't his security if he doesn't want them doing that they need to do their job and protect him or don't get in his space if somebody invaded my personal space I'd do the same a rich person having no regard for the property of the working class are we shocked that's absolutely rude and disrespectful these are the people who pay your salary the least you can do is treat them with some respect you don't have to want to take a photo but you can politely ask them to leave rather than throw their possessions someone responded saying everyone pays everyone's wages that got to do with personal space people need to stop acting like celebrities are their best friends you're a complete sharing to them you can't just run up invade their personal space and start recording actually yes you can they chose that life without fans they wouldn't sell records and this person responded saying you can be a fan without her and invading someone's personal space LMAO the conversation continues someone saying as a celebrity that's literally what you sign up for though these are the kind of people that make you famous and quite literally the reason you have the kind of Lifestyle you do I love Bad Bunny but that was foul so celebrities sign up to get hurt and run up on out of nowhere I thought it was so they could share their music with the world nah he could have stopped right there and asked her to back off instead he smiled to lure her into a false sense of security and then grip the phone out of her hand and threw it there are ways to deal with that sort of thing and that wasn't it Bad Bunny then decided to come forward on social media himself and speak out about the this whole situation saying that what the girl did was not tolerable even if she was a fan he initially tweeted out in Spanish which translates to the person who comes up to me to say hello to tell me something or just to meet me will always receive my attention and respect those who come to me to put a phone in my face I will consider it for what it is a lack of respect and I will treat it likewise but Bad Bunny has still gotten a lot of criticism on social media for throwing the woman's phone away and a lot of people think that was completely out of line on his end while the other majority of social media Justified what Bad Bunny did one girl over on Tick Tock made some interesting remarks and she explained why she thinks the girl was at fault so let me tell you guys why I'm not really mad at this I'm just gonna choose when I say this and if I lose followers I'm sorry but I feel like somebody like Bad Bunny whose impact and fame is at the magnitude of what his truly is he and so many other celebrities should start making examples out of people like this oh but that's what they signed up for they didn't sign up for you to be all up in their personal space not giving them even the slightest amount of basic regard for their [ __ ] to my understanding this was on New Year's Eve who the [ __ ] was to be on that New Year's Eve now let's consider some things maybe she was high maybe she was drunk or whatever it doesn't matter you need to be respecting people's personal space celebrities did not sign up for this type of they are not some type of wax figure that you can just walk up to and be like oh let me take a picture let me take a video don't do that man be respectful it definitely seems like this young lady had to learn it the hard way but many people are still opposed to what Bad Bunny ended up doing some even bringing up how it was morally wrong to just take this girl's property and just completely throw it away saying like who knows if this girl is able to afford another phone or how hard she worked for it things like that it's also important to note that recently in an interview with billboard Bad Bunny shared his plans for 2023 and this incident happened in the very beginning of 2023. Bad Bunny had made plans that he wanted to take a break in 2023 and of course having to know that this was how his 2023 would have started was probably not in his best interest he said 2023 is for me for my physical health my emotional health to breathe enjoy my achievements we're going to celebrate let's go here let's go there let's go on the boat I have a couple of sporadic commitments and I'll go to the studio but there is no pressure remember yourself you've worked off anyways guys that's what's been going on with Bad Bunny and this recent viral clip of him that's been going around and many people justifying as well as not justifying what he did I definitely want to know where you guys stand on this situation definitely let me know your thoughts in the comments down below love you guys so much and as always I'll see y'all in the next video foreign [Music]
