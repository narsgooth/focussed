go he's like tell me if you want to be in a relationship cuz if not like I'm leaving and I was like no go like whatever I didn't really did not think he was going to leave okay so let's start from the very beginning this is Morgan and she had a boyfriend and they were really a great couple their relationship was so good that Morgan herself admitted that she thought that they would get married I thought we were like going to get married or whatever but I think that when I got like pregnant I became unattracted to him now one day Morgan and her boyfriend received news that they are expecting a child together and the couple is Overjoyed but at the same time Morgan and her boyfriend were living far away from her parents so they decided to move closer to her parents' place in Michigan so she could be around her parents as she raised the baby so Morgan and her boyfriend pack up their stuff and mov to Michigan having kids going to be hard cuz my parents in Michigan he was like okay let's just move up to Michigan you can have help with your parents whatever D we mutually agreed to come to Michigan but this turns out not to be good for their relationship their relationship went downhill quickly after the move and they were both constantly fighting and getting angry at each other and it wasn't pretty L he gets like super depressed I get super depressed cuz obviously like I'm towards the end of the pregnancy I'm big as um I just was not driving I wasn't happy at all like I left my job I left my apartment I left all my friends in Georgia so anyways we move up here we just were not

her that he wanted out of the relationship like he was done and to make matters even worse he left Morgan to go and get back together with his ex I mean the audacity of this man is just so unbelievable and then this this is 4 days before my 23rd birthday so I was 22 um finally Valentine's Day rolls around which is my birthday 4 days after he ditched me I found out he moved in with his a so now of course when Morgan heard this shocking news she thought her boyfriend was playing like he couldn't possibly be serious they just had a kid together like a month ago but it turns out the guy was not joking the guy woke up in the morning kissed his daughter and left he didn't even pack his clothes that's how fast he wanted to be out of there and from that day onwards Morgan and her child never heard from him again yeah we haven't seen him since so it's it's just us now we're just vibing together I love her um if you guys see him he's somewhere in Atlanta so just let me know now even though she was completely heartbroken the guy whom she thought she would one day marry had left her Morgan wasn't just going to sit there and cry so she decided to fully dedicate her time and attention to raising her child and being the best mom she could so Morgan always had a very good sense of humor so she decided one day to start making Tik toks and sharing her journey as a single mother her Tik Tok soon blew up she was getting thousands of followers every day telling her stories about how a random man from Atlanta left her and her baby to get back together with his ex and loves I am telling you people loved her stories OMG I am so sorry but y'all are better off without the random man I am so glad you're away from that man but he makes for great stories you know you are doing so well in his absence keep strong and I am sorry that you were so disrespected it may be hard now but you dodged a bullet you're great Mom it's too hot outside to carry a kid everywhere I'm about to cry my sweating um I don't know if milk is leaking from these or if it's boob s that I feel on me but I'm hot um she can't walk nowhere she don't even have on shoes if she wanted to um it's too hot I got on this I couldn't even zip the damn bag I got on these three bags I got this random kit from Atlanta just attached to my hip all summer time this is not the outfit that I sent her in by the way um she came home from daycare this is not her shirt where is her bow at G where where did you put your bow at you you wear now as it turns out one of the thousands of people who were seeing Morgan's viral Tik toks was her ex or as Morgan loves to call him the random man from Atlanta one thing I have to inform you about my beautiful child's mother is her parents told me Morgan lies So Good Morgan can sell goddamn ice to a Eskimo you hear me now this guy was he didn't like how Morgan was talking about him in her videos so he decided to make a video setting the record straight about everything he revealed that Morgan was lying about him and he wasn't a deadbeat father the random man from Atlanta opened up and admitted that the reason he left Morgan was that he wasn't comfortable when they moved to be closer to Morgan's parents he said that it wasn't right what he did but Morgan also wasn't easy to deal with and that's why he left you guys have to understand I accept my responsibility far as I let the pressure get to me with everything that we had going on I had I was the first one to go viral Morgan never was viral so I was in a time where I wanted to change my life I was in the street set drugs you know that's the type Morgan like random man from Atlanta also said that he didn't disappear and that he tries to call Morgan and his daughter every day and actually it's Morgan who doesn't pick up his calls now this is when he dropped so seriously shocking news that nobody saw coming loves he revealed that he didn't just have one kid he had a total of six kids all with different women so knowing that GI was my sixth kid I wanted to be different from my other five I am sure when Morgan heard this news her world was shaken to its core now here is where it gets interesting because the random man said that he cared for Morgan so much that he gave up seeing his other children for over 2 years because he wanted to focus on making things work with Morgan imagine being one of his other kids and hearing your dad say that he intentionally gave up seeing you I mean that's got a heart loves he continued by saying that he had an entire plan of opening up a business so that he could provide for Morgan and and his child but he had to sacrifice that when Morgan said she wanted to be closer to her parents so knowing I had a clothing line going picked up a new trailer for a concrete business my mind was in an entrepreneur mode and I sacrificed all that for us to move to another city and state I did that to make things even worse he said that the only reason Morgan was blowing up and getting famous on social media was because of him random man said that when he was together with Morgan she didn't have a social media following and that only after she started started sharing stories about him is when she started getting followers he then proceeded to tell Morgan's followers to stop dragging his name through the mud saying that he's a deadbeat father when actually he loves caring for his child he even shared screenshots of his cash app where he showed that he allegedly sent Morgan $16,000 for the upkeep of their child however this didn't go down as he expected because Morgan came out and exposed him saying that in fact the cash app screenshot he shared was actually Morgan's money that he was using Morgan revealed that he didn't give her anything like at all video one is pretty much a screenshot of a cash app transaction that was seemingly between him and Morgan right because he wanted us to believe that he sent this girl $166,000 trying to make it seem like he is financially taking care of his child even though he physically is not there however my good S Morgan came with the receipts the real receipts and wasted no time shutting that down and pretty much told us that that man stole her cash app C and then every time he was using it he was letting her know like about to use a car about to use the car about to use the car so no that money was not going toward the child that left in any any type of way shape or form not going to lie I am sure the random man from Atlanta was expecting things to die down after he came out to set the record straight but what happened next was definitely the last thing he would have wanted because his world was about to be turned upside down remember when random man revealed that he had six kids well you know who happened to see the video all the other baby mamas and they weren't pleased with the things he was saying so one by one they decided to make videos exposing him as a deadbeat dad so that random man in Atlanta is my baby daddy too so I'm baby mama number two and I'm here to say that everything Morgan's saying is true and just how she was pregnant with their daughter and he had someone else pregnant similar situation with me I'm baby mama number one by the way turns out that they all had a similar story to Morgan they had a kid with random man from Atlanta and he just dumped and left them he didn't even bother to check up on his kids let alone give them child support money here is where this story gets even Wilder as random man's baby mamas were each revealing themselves his first and second baby mama made a shocking Discovery their children were born just 8 days apart my son has a brother that's 8 days older than him and yeah he doesn't call he hasn't called he doesn't help with anything he never has probably never will and yeah everything Morgan's saying is true we do got little boys and both of our boys are 8 years old and they are 8 days apart do you know what that means random man was cheating on these two women at the exact same time like he would go and spend time with his first baby mama and then make up an excuse and go spend time with his second baby mama and this went on for a very long time now all of random man's baby mamas were posting Tik toks identifying themselves but there was one who didn't post a video his fifth baby mama she took her time revealing herself but when she did I am telling you she brought the drama all right so Li baby just tried to post you know that give y'all thanks thank me you can't thank me cuz that's not my shirt so whoever that was she on you with cuz let me inform you 2019 I was involved with that so really it's the other way around if you want to be technical he the ni shot it on me you so after baby mama number five revealed herself she immediately started beefing with Morgan because one of her Tik toks turns out one day when Morgan was in a hurry she picked up a random shirt but she soon realized it wasn't her she learned that it belonged to baby mama number five and Morgan suspected that the shirt belonged to the person random man was cheating on her with and she assumed it was Baby Mama number five but baby mama number five wasn't too pleased about being called a cheater so she decided to drop some more shocking news to make this drama filled story even Messier baby mama number five revealed that first of all she was with random man from 2019 and Morgan began her relationship with random man in 2021 so in fact Morgan was actually the other woman because she was in a relationship and Morgan came along afterwards and random man cheated on her with Morgan he cheated on you with me no baby I've been around so please do your math okay and do you know what makes the situation even worse Morgan was in a relationship with random man for 2 years that means for two years random man was cheating on these two ladies at the same time just like he did Baby Mama number one and two then baby mama number five dropped an even bigger bombshell she said if that shirt wasn't hers and it wasn't Morgan's It could only mean one thing random man had another lady this means he was actually cheating on three ladies for God knows how long all at the same time I don't know how but somehow this story just continues to have more shocking twists and turns now one day Morgan was just chilling trying to catch a break in the middle of this never-ending drama then she received a phone call and by the end of the call she was almost in tears something tells me that Beyonce's in studio right now working her tail end off trying to make this six Baby Mama song inspired by me what Beyonce doesn't know and what's very important for beyon to know is that I just got a phone call from baby mama I don't even know first time hearing about her ever today she came with the receipts and the proof and I am not the first baby mom I am not the second baby mom Beyonce I'm not the third baby mom I'm not the fourth baby mom I'm not the fifth baby mom Beyonce I am not even the sixth baby mom Beyonce make sure you tell these folks I am the seventh baby mom and sing that song so good so apparently remember how random man said he had six kids with six different ladies turns out he lied the guy actually had seven kids that's right seven kids with seven different ladies this meant that Morgan wasn't actually baby mama number six as she thought she was Baby Mama number seven Morgan's life must be so upside down right now to go from thinking a guy was going to marry you and you two would spend the rest of your lives together to him dumping you after you had your child to then finding out he had seven children with other ladies that has got to hurt I tell you this man was Anonymous his ex which he meant when she was 19 years old and he was 30 went through painstaking efforts to not reveal his name but rather call him a random man from Atlanta and used specifically the city of Atlanta because of how Anonymous he could be and he not only outs himself and reveals a prior location where he lived now there's like six to seven other baby mamas now as far as random man in Atlanta during all this time he was sharing screenshots of M messages from Morgan where she said that she misses him and that she wanted them to get back together but Morgan came out and set the record straight Morgan admitted that yes she had indeed sent him a bunch of messages saying that she wanted to get back together with him but this was just after he had left her and she was still heartbroken Morgan admitted that on the day he left her and her child to get back together with his ex Morgan said she called him close to 80 times trying to get him to come back and work things out this is so embarrassing to say but I dropped to my knees begging him to stay cuz I was so scared I had only been a mom for 30 days I was straight out of a C-section so I couldn't even like move around yet it was so bad yeah so he just left like and I remember I literally I probably called him like 80 times before he hit Ohio okay yeah I think he was like blocking me like most of the time so I just had no contact with him for most of the drive there which really sucked cuz I was like sitting in my room like literally like should I die now but no no that's not the answer that's not the answer don't do that but as of now Morgan says that it's actually random man that's in her DM is trying to get her back random man is trying so hard even shared a screenshot where he apparently saved an elderly lady I think he's trying to show the world that he's a changed man now that everyone thinks he's a deadbeat dad loves what do y'all think about this whole drama has random man really changed or is he just trying to make it seem that way because now he's been exposed let me know your thoughts and opinions in the comments
09/17/2023,Emily Dobson FINALLY Reveals Why She Left The Squad...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSin9w1jnps,194-11, y'all if there is one person who deserves an early holiday it is definitely Piper because she has been through the most this year Piper has literally been in a suffering marathon and she just can't seem to catch a break it's like Pipers in a spicy soap opera with each day bringing more drama and less peace and she's about ready to change the channel which brings us to one of her latest predicaments so you already know that the squad fell out because of a very unfortunate and awful reasons which we'll talk about shortly but to see each member coming out with their own departure story is one thing most of us didn't see coming there have even been rumors that Emily Dobson and Piper's friendship Is On The Rocks but like we always say everything is a rumor until it comes out of the horse's mouth and it did Emily Dobson finally confirmed leaving the squad guys and as it turns out so much has been going on behind the scenes Emily's not in the squad anymore it's a Open Secret let me fill you in on the latest update on Emily Dobson Piper and the entire Squad so without further Ado let's get into it Emily made a tick tock video talking about how her mental health has been dramatically affected and the caption read when you are crying because of stress then it turns into crying over my insecurities crying over getting a ton of homework and crying over wanting Chick-fil-A on a Sunday so basically Emily was saying she has been having mental breakdowns which explains why some people believe she's taking a break from social media furthermore she hasn't posted videos on her YouTube channel for over three months to further fuel things one of the squad's photographers revealed in an interview that apparently Emily stopped shooting with that even though there hasn't been an official statement about her leaving Piper's Squad yes Tiffany made the children sign contracts but we'll discuss that later on in the video Let's just first focus on Emily's departure Piper hasn't been very forthcoming about the whole situation but she has dropped subtle hints here and there about the state of their friendship she was on a tour where numerous of her fans turned up to see their favorite celebrity but you already know that the people wanted to see other Squad members too the fact that Emily was M.I.A isn't something that Emily was willing to let slide so when Piper decided to have a q a session after one of her shows literally everyone had just one question where is Emily apart from the fans who showed up during the tour the online family also flooded Piper's comment section with this very same concern just take a look Emily was my favorite she doesn't deserve this people are concerned with Piper but I am more concerned with Emily because there have been things about what's happening between Emily and Piper so I think Emily's being forced to do all these here's all they had to say about the matter since medium stuff right now and work on herself family style School whatever right not to mention the time when Piper went off on a fan who was innocently inquiring about Emily the fan wrote hey Piper I was wondering what is happening because like everyone is saying that Emily left the squad and your mom has also been doing some bad things what is going on Piper was so offended by these questions that she responded to you and everyone else please stop asking me these questions it is so disrespectful in so many ways it hurts my feelings and I hate it also loves isn't it so weird how Piper went off on this van who literally wasn't rude to her the funny part is that most people even said it was actually Tiffany who responded and not Piper which makes sense because she obviously helps Piper handle her social media accounts in spite of everything that has been said the most important one is that Emily is okay and taking care of her Mental Health on another note loves can we talk about the contracts that Tiffany made these kids sign before joining the squad and this is one thing that most of the ex-squad members have confirmed in the past of course there has to be some sort of agreement because duh money was involved and each Squad member is directly responsible for the success Piper enjoys to date however most people are curious to know were the squad members really friends or business partners like can we even believe that they genuinely used to hang out as best friends or was it all for the vibe remember when Gavin uploaded a video on his YouTube channel in November 2019 explaining why he had to break up with Piper when he revealed that their Affair was more of a business Arrangement that was being managed by none other than Piper's mom Tiffany he said that things were so toxic because Piper's mom took total control of his life including the people he was allowed to hang out with and the events he could attend y'all Piper's mom literally had to approve Gavin before he could hang out with anyone Gavin managed to put up with all of these unreasonable demands for about seven months but he said it stopped being fun and he had to stop because his life was becoming very stressful 11 members of Raquel Squad have sued Raquel and her mom accusing them of sexual battery intentional infliction of emotional distress and then trying to destroy their YouTube channels after they left the show 22 million dollar lawsuit filed in Los Angeles detailed several instances when Raquel's mother made explicit comments like body shaming one Squad member because she had no boobs another one said that she once asked him whether his nether regions had developed Piper's mom could even go as far as talking about adult toys with these kids the squad members mostly girls also confessed to being made to pose or wear clothes that made them uncomfortable oh yeah Tiffany would always tell me to go up into Piper's closet and get something that's more tight and revealing fans were super shocked that contracts were involved which even made it difficult to determine whether the squad members were really friends or whether everything was just a business Arrangement wait you're telling me that they had to sign a contract to make friends Emily left though Piper and Emily were best friends apparently OMG a contract that's too far what Tiffany has done to Piper is so sad do you know that most people still hold on to the opinion that the squads Fallout is all Tiffany's fault and where is the lie because had she been a decent grown-up the squad members wouldn't be suing her for thousands of dollars over very awful and dehumanizing allegations like a toxic work environment Financial exploitation and being forced to do obscene things just to show how toxic Tiffany was to the squad a fan asked Gavin if Piper's mom really offered him a vape when he was younger and even though he seemed uncomfortable at first saying he couldn't answer that question he eventually said yes [Music] is it just me who thinks the fact that he didn't want to answer means that she did because why else would he hesitate as if all this wasn't enough ex-squad members have also revealed how Tiffany would go out to her all of their efforts of starting their own YouTube channels some of them have even reported having their channels reported for violating YouTube terms of service and Community guidelines and you know how YouTube works the more strikes you get the higher the chances of your channel being brought down so this woman didn't only allegedly harass and abuse a bunch of kids she's also apparently made it her life mission to ensure they never Prosper like she just derives so much joy from harassing a bunch of kids and do you know how she managed to get away with it for so many years making them sign contracts with unreasonable terms and conditions as we wait to see how things unfold for Emily Piper and the squads we can only hope for all of the drama to stop and for them to solve their differences peacefully it is evident that so many people still love them anyways loves I would love to hear your opinion on this situation station down below also don't forget to click on the tab for more videos on these celebrities and influencers
ad,ad: Google Pixel 7/Pro Review: Hard Problems? Software Answers!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE5H5intsck,0-20,(upbeat music)  All right Pixel 7s 7 and 7 Pro. I've been using these phones for about a week now and yes they are very similar to last year. They're the same prices too. But more than ever this year and you can see it at every corner the Pixel's special is software solutions to hardware problems. And this is in contrast to say the Samsung or the Xiaomi special which is throw as much raw hardware horsepower at the thing as possible. There's just no way that isn't better than before. And there's nothing right or wrong with either of these approaches. Matter of fact as a techhead you can kind of appreciate both. But there is just a little bit of a magic to the software way at least when it works. So yeah I can definitely appreciate the slightly updated hardware on the outside of the Pixel. Because even though it isn't super important to the Google mission it's still important to the users. So initially with my very first handson I didn't love it but it's kind of growing on me. The main change here being the metal camera bar instead of the allglass visor from last year. It lets them do some interesting stuff with the colors but most importantly lets them make it all one piece of metal all the way around with the frame of the rest of the phone. It's polished aluminum on the Pro and matte aluminum on the Pixel 7. Then both phones also get brighter displays up to 1500 nits peak on the 7 Pro and 1400 knits on the regular Pixel 7. Can't fake that with software. And then the 7 Pro display is larger slightly curved over the edges. And a generally betterlooking display with less offaxis rainbowing. But interestingly it's set to 1080p outthebox by default even though it's a 1440p panel. I immediately switch that to 1440 and have had no battery issues. So I recommend doing that. Matter of fact might as well just say it right off the top. I have had great battery experiences with these phones. I've been mostly dailying the 7 Pro. David at the studio's been dailying the 7. And yeah they've been excellent. Like just this morning today drove into the studio had an hourlong commute with Waze on full brightness GPS streaming Spotify audio through Bluetooth to the car. Got here with like 85% battery left. And I'm consistently ending days with 30 to 40%. Six to 7 hours is not a problem. Yeah I've had very good battery life on these phones. Very impressive. That's a combination of software optimization better modems just better chip overall. But speaking of chips inside the phone there are very few new specs but the new second generation Tensor G2 from Google is one of 'em. There's also a little bit extra RAM on the Pro phone. It does benchmark a bit higher than the first Tensor but in terms of raw power it's right in line with the Snapdragon 865 fine. But just like I talked about in the problem with benchmarks video which you can watch here if you haven't seen it already Google is optimizing this Tensor G2 chip to work more efficiently specifically with its AI stuff it's AI magic. So while yeah the G2 is a little faster than the first Tensor with its smaller 4nanometer process node the real improvements are in its machine learning capabilities which are 60% faster and 20% more efficient than last year. So the things that actually require those AI smarts are dramatically better and faster. So that is where it starts to get interesting. Not to dismiss the slight improvements of the Pixel overall. I mean you can see they even they painted inside the port and the speakers down here to match the revs of the phone. It's nice I like it. But that's not what the Pixel is all about. The Pixel is the software. It is the smartest smartphone and pretty much all of the reasons you'd pick a phone like a Pixel 7 over the rest are in the software. Like for phone calls for example Pixel is the only phone with call screening which to me is still super useful but it also goes to another level. So when you call a business that has an automated system the improved Direct my Call feature will surface all the buttons at once so you can press to navigate through an automated system before the robot even finishes saying them. It saves me so much time. I love that. I also like the new home screen search which still has all the great functionality as before it's just cleaner and better designed. And then with the new selfie camera the Pixel has added AIbased face unlock which is great but as you can see it's just a single selfie camera up top here. There's no infrared depth mapping or face ID equivalent. So while it's super fast in great conditions it absolutely struggles as expected when you're in the dark or when you have a mask on. So there's also still an under display fingerprint reader for dual biometric authentication anytime face unlock fails. I will say I was hoping that the fingerprint reader would be one of the things that improved to the Pixel 7 hardwarewise because the one in the 6 was a little bit of a letdown for me. It's not noticeably bigger or faster. It fine it's not terrible. It's just a slight step behind the ultrasonic ones which are noticeably faster than this optical one. Oh also the Recorder app. Most some people don't even care about this but the Recorder app is better. It's already the best in the world at doing incredibly fast and accurate speechtotext. You've seen this before thanks Tensor. But I got an amazing demo of somebody starting a recording and then putting the phone in their pocket and we had a full on conversation. They took the phone out of their pocket and it had perfectly transcribed our entire conversation with speaker labels. So each time the opposite person spoke it labeled that. Incredibly useful or incredibly creepy depending on who you are. But that's one of the features that's allegedly coming later this year to an update. I'm gonna be using that. And it just definitely feels like anywhere you go on this phone Google Assistant is waiting right around the corner waiting to help you out. It was the same with the last Pixel. Android 13 got its improvements with Material You and the under the hood improvements. But just the Google stuff everywhere the routines the little reminders the little chip cards and messages for helpful things you might wanna do to add to a message. There's a lot of good stuff. There's even a new feature called Photo Unblurr. You might have seen the demos. Basically takes any photo in your Pixel 7's library actually anything in your Google Photos library at all. And if it's a little bit blurry you hit that unblur button and it can use AI to identify what the scene should look like and fix the photo remove the blur. Seems super cool. So okay after trying this with a bunch of photos we found that it seems to work best specifically with photos of subjects that are in focus but the exposure time was too long and so now there's a bit of blur in one direction. In that exact instance I found it can do a pretty good job of turning a streaky blurry photo into something much more usable. I wouldn't expect anything magical but you know this is pretty cool. It's the definition of using software to solve hardware problems. Also they do say Pixel 7 exclusive for this feature for now I don't really buy it. They say it's because of Tensor G2. I give it about a year before this feature is available for more phones maybe anyone using Google Photos. But hey for now gotta have the Pixel 7. But the point is Google is not setting out to make a phone with the absolute best hardware and the best display and the absolute best raw performance. I mean if they are they're failing. But Google Pixel is absolutely the smartest smartphone in the room. It's the smartest phone you can get and it's even more true again this year. Now the Pixel has been known for one other thing probably as long as anything else and that's the cameras. And there's an updated suite of cameras on the front and the back of the Pixel 7s this year. So the 50 megapixel primary camera is the same on both same as last year. The Pro gets a new even wider ultrawide with autofocus while the 7 keeps the one from last year. And the Pro also gets a new 5x 48megapixel telephoto camera. And as expected the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro take excellent photos in a variety of different lighting conditions and they have that very distinct Pixel style the high dynamic range contrasty lots of detail those shots. This big sensor can create some pretty nice natural depth of field still without using portrait mode. I love that. I know I shouldn't be super impressed that you know normal daylight photos look great on the Pixel but hey these are really really good. And then the new Pro ultrawide does a really good job with macro photography. Doesn't do macro video but this photo of an ant is really hard to get. And the auto switching to macro mode can be disabled if you're like me and prefer taking close up photos of things with the main camera. Just beware of minimum focus distance. But then here's another great example of solving hardware problems with software. The zoom so the 1x camera still normal 1x. That's a 50megapixel main sensor binning down to 12 megapixels. The 2x button is a 12megapixel crop of the middle of the frame so a high quality zoom. Then from 2x to 5x the camera's actually doing some composition. It's adding detail in the middle of the frame from the telephoto camera and then compositing them together. Then you get to 5X and it's snapping to the full telephoto camera. That makes perfect sense. Then again the 10x is taking a 12megapixel crop of the middle of the telephoto so another high quality zoom. And it's pretty good. I will say it's not quite as good as having a dedicated 10x telephoto camera on the back of the phone. Like having a dedicated camera is always gonna give you the sharper overall image. But for someone like me who only zooms once in a while the whole Super Res Zoom software solution is very passable as you can see and then that saves you money. And then you get the zoom stabilization that activates at 15x and it is really really stable. Maybe a little too stable sometimes because it kind of makes it hard to track moving objects which I know you love to do when you're creeping I mean bird watching. Anyway yeah the Pixel's camera is still top of the heap when it comes to pointandshoot Android cameras. The shutter speed is super fast. So if you're trying to freeze motion and also capture like an exact moment this camera's really good at that. The selfie cameras on both are also improved. It's now an 11megapixel selfie camera. They both do ultrawide selfies now instead of just the Pro. Love that. And video is slightly better too including 10bit HDR. Tough to show that in this SDR video but if you've seen HDR video before you know where this excels already. Anything with bright specular highlights loads of dynamic range et cetera it's still a step behind the iPhone when it comes to noise levels and autofocus. So for those curious why I still put the iPhone as the overall king of smartphone imagery that's why. But this is not far behind by any means. Okay here's a couple other small things that didn't fit into the rest of this review. The speakers on the 7 Pro are slightly louder but slightly less bassey than the 6 Pro just a little tinier. So a little less low end for a little bit more vocal clarity. I found that interesting. And then there's not a whole lot going for sustainability for these phones other than the metal visor and frame being made with 100% recycled materials. Some pretty specific wording there. But also the box it comes in which doesn't have a charger does come with a cable and an adapter and is fully recyclable cardboard. And then a big question are there bugs? Because my Pixel 6 experience was a roller coaster. I mean I loved the phone to start but then it slowly descended into having more and more bugs until it was like unusable to me and I stopped using it. Then it got some updates that squashed those bugs and then I ended up dailying it for like the last two months or so. So are their bugs on the Pixel 7s? Yeah I have found some. I mean I had this media player bug where it just shows a blank space where the media player's supposed to be whether or not there was any media playing. That did go away after reboot. There was also this weird thing where after you hit the X in the Google search bar that button just disappears but it's still pressable for some reason. Also I tried to post the Instagram Story from the Pixel 7 Pro the other day and it just looked like this for some reason. Honestly no idea what happened here. Everyone saw it. Apparently some people thought it was an ad for dbrand's new Digital Camo. It wasn't. But this is. Hey if your new metal bar isn't enough and you want your new Pixel to look even more different from the rest channel sponsor dbrand's new skin is pretty sick and it's a foolproof way to make your phone look unique. Plus it hopes to hide that dust that sort of naturally accumulates right above and below the camera bar. So link below of course. Right below that like button. But I've really enjoyed using the Pixel and that's why it's going in my pocket as my daily driver phone for now anyway. As far as whether you should get one or not I think the real question is how much money are you willing to spend? Because same prices as last year 599 899. And I think my initial feeling is I still feel the same which some people got kind of twisted by the way. But the $300 difference between these phones the Pixel 7 is a way better deal than the 7 Pro. Like they're both wellpriced and they're both very competitive and frankly undercutting most of what they're competing against. But the 7 is just for most people a nobrainer. So this is the phone I'm gonna be recommending more often. Probably a Value Phone of the Year contender. Again look there's a lot of stuff Google didn't do with the Pixels like they didn't do super fast 80watt charging. They didn't do multiple telephoto cameras. It doesn't even fold in half right? There's a lot of stuff. But for patient Pixel people who prefer pristine programming and pretty pictures the Pixel Pro is pretty perfect. (bright music) 
09/15/2023,This Is The CREEPIEST Siblings On TikTok..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHDxAG_k4uU,191-11, the other day I stumbled upon a tick tocker creating an amsr video in a graveyard and I just remember thinking what makes a really good now this is the peak of Madness but here's the thing about Tick Tock y'all just when you think you've witnessed the ultimate mystery someone always snatches the crown like Tick Tock is just one big circus of ever escalating chaos where you get your daily dose of absurdity let me draw your attention to Kevin Camino and guys his content qualifies as evidence of why Tick Tock should be banned this well over 20 year olds has gained a massive following for creating rather disturbing videos with his baby brother one of Kevin's most viral videos which received over 24 million views is this extremely creepy and questionable video of his brothers seemingly playing with his nipple and Kevin is just over there looking tense with desire as if he's ready to do some illegal and unethical things to his bro anyone in Italy please call the cops this child isn't anything above three years old this is a child and him playing with Kevin is besides the point but what did the adult in the situation do took out his camera sat calmly and turned this into an erotic telenovela episode he even accompanied it with some romantic music also have you noticed The Tick-Tock sound he chose for this video it's called gay rights and don't get me wrong I'm 10 toes deep front row in support of gay rights but when you're potentially targeting your little brother ciao look at his eyes giving predator I wouldn't be surprised that so much goes on behind the camera because y'all if he can record and post this what is stopping him from doing worse this is one of those videos that you never hope to bump into because they kill your faith in human entity the saddest part is that Kevin didn't stop there he literally has numerous videos doing this kind of thing furthermore Kevin switches things up by writing cryptic captions like wow how strange my brother is fine we both know that the fine Kevin is referring to here because so far it's no doubt we're dealing with a child offender do you know what I hate the most about the internet is that regardless of your content You'll Always Find Your tribe you could be filming paint drawing and there would be a group of enthusiasts commenting wow that's some top-notch drawing action this is the only platform where people will numb any ounce of Reason in them and support a child offender me obsessed with you yes I mean have you seen these comment section people are literally gallivanting I'm obsessed with you oh so adorable Kevin is making a video kissing his brother and letting him play with his body but someone's main takeaway is how perfect the kid's teeth are but here's the one comment that shook me to the root of my existence this follower wrote everything is wrong about this but ah this means there are a bunch of people who find Kevin's Behavior creepy but you know what calling him out is where they draw the line anyways as time went by a few sane people started questioning his actions and Kevin kind of panicked so he felt the need to prove to people that he wasn't attracted to his brother Kevin posted this video with his girlfriend but conveniently covered her face so I guess it could be a potato in there who knows someone commented even suggesting that it was his brother in a wig POV it's the little kid in a wig that's your baby brother is that a kid these concerns cannot be far from the truth because Kevin didn't show us anything of course Kevin has been thriving with the millions of views he gets and he's literally built his entire brand around creating inappropriate content with his kid brother actually if you use quicktalk account with his brother have the most views so here's the thing whenever people say kids should not be actively posted on social media it is actually to protect them you see those millions of views don't just come from Kevin's followers who think that the baby teeth are cute a good percentage of Kevin's viewers are also into the unsettling stuff he does with this kid so they watch these videos to satisfy their selfish desires being over 20 years old Kevin already knows this but he keeps making inappropriate videos with this innocent kid to satisfy his equally predatory audience so once again I asked who is in Italy and how can we get the cops attention cops aside many people also want to know where are the parents are all of these things going on under their roof without a clue unless of course Kevin has the custody of the kid or something which would be scandalous to be fair many have no idea what Kevin posts online but are you telling me none of his relatives friends or neighbors watch his videos I don't see that possibility because Kevin posted online surely someone close to him knows what he's doing and it is hard to believe that such Behavior can go completely unnoticed in today's digital age where there is evidence in plain sight we've seen countless instances of individuals leaving digital Footprints of their heinous crimes on social media without facing immediate consequences and still managing to evade Justice there are more disturbing videos on Kevin's Tick Tock guys am I the only one who finds this video disturbing so the kid is sleeping on his lap but when you look closely you'll notice his brother's hand resting on Kevin's groin while Kevin is stroking the kids hair now tell me how any of this is okay to make matters worse his caption read I'm comfortable and y'all in the comments of this video they are super annoying move kid it's my turn okay now the baby is cute but it's my turn it's clear Kevin is posting thirst trap videos using his little brother leaving the poor kid vulnerable to all sorts of comments this one literally describes the kid as hot forget the dude can we talk about how hot the baby is our people normal someone creates a video doing inappropriate things to his brother and everyone else is like oh can I get a tutorial for that at this point I'm sure that if Kevin were to put all these shenanigans on a merch people would buy it [Music] again the song in the background the kid isn't obsessed with you you're the problem Kevin also this is what I meant when I said Kevin Garners millions of views because his content attracts so many perverts someone had the nerve to outrightly write this the kid is so cute can I have him and then this one took things to the next level oh my God I'm dying of sweetness such a sweet kid I actually liked a lot of my life a lot more before bumping into this cabin guy do you know who this reminds me of do y'all remember the infamous tick tocker who was also doing this kind of stuff with his sister well his account got banned a while ago but guess what he's back and you'd think he'd change now right you wish they are all still doing the same [ __ ] so a bunch of you guys have been asking why do I live in a hotel well the reason is [Music] keeping you again sir you're gonna have to leave the room if you're interrupting me right now I'm speaking to my fans okay I don't like housekeeping right now you know what just clean this up and then get out of here okay hi thank you goodbye [Music] anyways they've got a great breakfast I lose my mind how tick-tockers normalize things like sibling relationships I mean relationship content is cute and viewers live for relationship goals PDA drama but when do you ever look at your sibling and go hey sis why don't we make dating videos where we can awkwardly whisper sweet nothings to each other and sometimes have a couple fights it's just baffling how social media blurs the lines between different kinds of relationships and while most viewers just run with anything the few who find such content cringe fear calling it out for the risk of not being considered woke also sometimes you don't want to look but you just can't look away which makes it a win-win for even the most bizarre content creators because whether they kiss graveyards or kiss their siblings online they get views Jordy Vena and Diana Camila Avila started by posting out usual stuff that you'd expect to find on Tick Tock like comedy dance challenges cosplay and skits but things took a sudden twist when they boldly announced that they were in a relationship yes Queen who do you think lumps more in this relationship unlike Kevin and his minor brother Diana and Jordy are both adults in their 20s but ew the fact that they are consenting adults still doesn't justify their relationship guys when I say Diana and Jordy post relationship content you might think it's at least modest right no they go all out let me show you what I mean baby yep while we've been together have you found any girl pretty [Music] um definitely [Music] [Music] I meant you oh okay first of all her annoying high-pitched baby voice is higher than my patience during rush hour traffic even dogs cover their ears around her also it's a fake voice can she speak like a normal 20 year old adult that's not all loves I haven't shown you the rest of the video I need you to listen to this I thought you cheated on me and I got so scared there's nothing to be scared of your step bro loves no your ears are not deceiving you you hear correctly they are step sibling things for real this is literally as classy as a pig at a tea party today I'm dressed up and my step brother is just [Music] Peter Pan away your wings Peter Pan doesn't need wings [Music] gross in this video they are trying to recreate their first kiss guys it's like Diana and Jordy have a million fantasies to fulfill and remember that they are step siblings guys laughs moving forward when they eventually have enough people criticizing their relationship here is what they had to say you guys are completely right even though we're not blood related and like we love each other and we feel so good with each other like I haven't found anybody that makes me feel this way but you guys are right that's right even though we're just step siblings you you guys are right we can't do this anymore so we've decided to just say too bad for you we love each other and if you don't like it well too bad [Music] we're proudly step siblings we get it that they aren't blood related but aren't they still family I wonder how their parents deal with this mess because they started dating after their parents got together I never thought I'd be talking about siblings breaking up but here we are anyways at some point they broke up and their Tick Tock candle also disappeared imagine seeing your ex at a dinner family reunion LOL Diana has her own Tick Tock account though and she rarely posts on it maybe because now she's in dental school which of course is time consuming Diana even gave sort of a clue why they broke up when she answered a fan saying he probably wanted to see other people like their cousin or something honestly I've never been happier about a breakup like this anyways loves thanks for watching and I would

08/19/2023,What’s Going On With Piper & Lev Cameron?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZMjzwi_cbo,184-11,what's popping team Piper and love gather around because there's trouble in Paradise it looks like the picture-perfect fairy tale romance between social media Sensations Piper Raquel and love Cameron has hit a major roadblock this is a scoop you don't want to miss so there I was lounging around like any other day just casually thumb scrolling through my phone is hanging around you know the usual routine checking out the latest memes and adorable pet videos but then a blink and you miss it moment turned my chill session into a full-blown OMG moment it was Piper's YouTube shorts video that got my heart racing Piper posted this video which is simply a collection of heart fluttering moments that she and Lev shared on screen in the three years they've been together the smiles the laughter the trips the adventures and basically the couple goals Vibes that summarize their beautiful love story but before I pinned a heart emoji on it the caption almost got me dropping my phone right below the video Piper dropped a bombshell after three years it's over say what now guys did Piper just confirm breaking up with Lev if the videos they've been posting on YouTube and Tick Tock are anything to go by they haven't seemed to be having issues which is why this isn't even a plot twist but a plot earthquake y'all as a matter of fact Piper and left have been hanging out quite often you see loves it's not like we're not used to celebrity breakups but this one has caught us a bit off guard to the point that a good number of their followers think it's a prank what could have gone so terribly heartbreakingly wrong overnight I'm so sorry Piper I know you really loved him and I hope we can help you through this I am so sorry hope you are okay Piper and just know there are many people here for you during this tough time you guys are so cute together I'm literally about to cry any second guys please make a video about this you guys have a lot of stuff to say to your viewers and just like that what was once a match made in social media heaven now seems to be hanging by a thread but hang on a second there's definitely more to the story like y'all already know by now Piper has been going through a roller coaster ride with twists and turns because everything around her seems to be crumbling and we can't deny the fact that the drama in Piper's life that may have led to this insta perfect couple Calling it Quits okay fam let's start right from the beginning for starters Piper has lost so much weight that her followers are raising eyebrows people have been asking whether she's okay both on her posts and on levs like in this Tick Tock dance video that Lev posted y'all nobody even focused on them dancing comment after comment was just about Piper's transformation what happened to Piper OMG is Piper okay is Piper okay she looks different she's so tiny now still gorgeous but tiny I thought I was the only one that noticed she does look okay people have just been curious about why she's been so hell-bent on losing weight even though she looks good anyway you all know there's a chance she's so fixated in this fitness journey as a coping mechanism for everything she's going through right people resort to different things when they're stressed like laying in bed all day binge watching their favorite shows dress eating a whole bag of chips or even diving headfirst into a hobby they've never tried before guys Piper even has a premium subscription where she's been documenting her workout routines if this breakup is indeed real it couldn't have come at a worse time for Piper because she doesn't even have friends at the moment keep in mind y'all that all the squad members have been distancing themselves from her and it's even worse that they're suing Piper and her mother for a whopping 22 million dollars for being mistreated on set based on her recent youTube content there's a noticeable shift taking place because her videos no longer feature any of her Pals for those who have been following Piper's Journey from the beginning y'all know she never used to feature her boyfriend love and ex-gavin every so often but with no friends she's had no alternative because she still needs to create content and as if that's not enough Piper's circle of friends and relationship with love aren't the only parts of her life that are facing a downfall her mom hasn't exactly been her greatest cheerleader what most people forget is that if she has indeed treated ex-squad members poorly and forced them into uncomfortable situations then she has most definitely subjected Piper to lots of discomforts just to keep up with the fame so Piper literally has no friends no supportive family is undergoing drastic weight loss a lawsuit and now a heartbreak it is an overwhelming load for a 15 year old child to Bear keep in mind loves that this isn't the first split between Piper and Lev Lev went on to clarify that the distance had taken its toll on their relationship prompting their split back in 2022 they hit a bump when they found themselves separated by Miles my girlfriend and I are on a break let me explain Lev went on to clarify that the distance had taken its toll on them because they couldn't handle a long-distance relationship as fate would have it they would later reunite and explained that they weren't on a full-fledged breakup but rather a mutual pause while they navigated through the twists and turns of their feelings Piper and her mom went all the way across the country for Christmas and New Year's you see where they are is a six hour flight away or a one day and six hour drive or a nine day and 18 hour bicycle ride and yeah I don't want to do let's just say a long distance relationship wasn't what we were both hoping for in the middle of this current storm it appears that Piper's ex-boyfriend Gavin might just be the only person who is still on Piper's ship and honestly at this point we're literally hoping he doesn't jump out too because she needs someone to lean on interestingly there are even some who are kind of low-key celebrating Piper's split from love because they've always been team Piper and Gavin real or not she's gonna go right back to Gavin it's Gavin time to shine I've always had a feeling that Gavin and Piper would make up this is a sign Gavin is Piper's One and Only Love as you all know Piper has been hanging out a lot with both her ex Gavin and her boyfriend lab and some fans are speculating that this might have made Lev uncomfortable at some point and that's why he eventually decided to break up with Piper They are even happy about the breakup because they feel Piper has been too controlling I don't know about y'all but if Piper and Love's breakup is real I don't think it has anything to do with the three of them hanging out together Lev and Gavin have been pretty cool around each other in fact they recently did a q a video on Gavin's Channel and answered a bunch of questions from fans for instance someone asked Gavin if he enjoyed being friends with lab and he said he actually does love him love you boys any buddies I love you too someone also asked Lev if he was comfortable with all the pranks Gavin usually pulls on Piper he told fans to be on the lookout because he'll be pranking Gavin back very soon is land full with all the pranks you've been doing on Piper are you cool with the pranks have been oh are you like are you like cool with that I don't know I'm gonna have to talk to my people have him get back to you during practice these days I guess that's your answer guys just expect to see some assists buddy so yeah web is pretty cool with Gavin you know what guys if we really think about it Piper and Gavin could have a real shot at staying together but you see things took a different turn because of Piper's mom and her not so great Behavior if it weren't for that who knows they might still be a couple in November 2019 Gavin uploaded a video on his YouTube channel explaining why he had to break up with Piper where he revealed that their Affair was more of a business Arrangement that was being managed by none other than Piper's mom Tiffany he said that things were so toxic because Piper's mom took control of his life including the people he was allowed to hang out with and the events he could attend y'all Piper's mom literally had to approve before Gavin could hang out with anyone Gavin managed to put up with all these unreasonable demands for about seven months but he said it stopped being fun and so he had to stop because his life was becoming very stressful you'd assume Piper's mom would let Gavin off the hook so easily but boy oh boy Tiffany got a different approach she was far from pleased and took it to the extreme by kicking off the hashtag unfollowgavin campaign online leading to Gavin losing thousands of followers she's been following the same Playbook with the ex-squad members reporting their channels and stirring up a storm anyways have y'all imagined how weird it will be if Gavin and Piper got back together like does that mean that Lev and Gavin won't be friends anymore it'll be too messy y'all but that's besides the point loves let's shift our Focus to Piper's current situation because if indeed Piper and Lev have called it quits we'd love to see whether Gavin can step up and become the rock that she needs in this challenging time the bond that they share might just prove to be the Saving Grace Piper requires to navigate through this tough phase even with all these in mind Labs the big question surrounding Piper and loves breakup remains was it the pressures of Fame the struggles of young love Piper's mom or something entirely unexpected anyways loves let's wait and see how things unfold stay tuned cause I'll keep you updated with more Deets on Piper and Love's latest drama they'll definitely have to address this at some point in the future also loves have you watched the video on Piper's concerning weight loss click here if you haven't 
08/18/2023,People Are CONCERNED About Piper Rockelle’s Weight Loss?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXnF5R0uOt8,182-11,if you've been scrolling through your feeds you'll agree that Piper Raquel's dramatic body transformation is undeniable and this physical change has left fans wondering what is the story behind her sudden swim down a bunch of Piper's fans are actually feeling concerned and they think that there might be something going on behind the scenes they're not sure if everything's okay and they're wondering if there's something else going on that they don't know about yes I'm glad I wasn't the only one who noticed it's like starting to worry me a little bit but I meant I just want her to be healthy we don't know what happens behind closed cameras however my hypothesis is that Piper's weight loss is not healthy like she has lost so much weight in such a short amount of time and that is really concerning not to mention her Evo mom even I noticed her major weight loss and honestly I just hope she's fine the things that Piper has gone through is getting sad at this point and don't get me wrong loves she looks okay people just want to know if she's doing this for the right reasons especially because she was already looking okay anyway Piper even has a premium subscription where where she's been treating her fans to an array of heart-pounding workout videos what's a bit strange but also really impressive is how super determined Piper is seriously she is so focused that she doesn't even skip a day Piper's gone to the point where she's doing workouts even at night just to keep up with her routine that is some serious dedication right there hey cuties come along with me to do my first ever workout at night today was probably one of the busiest days of my whole life I didn't have time to work out this morning so I've never done a nighttime workout before and that's why I'm bringing you guys along with me talk about dedication right but what is this sudden obsession with Fitness that she can't even skip a day is it really about discipline here's where the Intrigue deepens y'all amidst all the excitement of her fitness journey there have been a series of events in Piper's life that can justify why her followers are raising eyebrows and wondering if there's more to the story you all know that Piper has been through a lot and bear in mind she is only 15 so yeah her sudden Fitness spree could be away to handle things or feel better as much as it is a healthy thing to do it could also be a coping mechanism to numb all the pain she's been experiencing and before you say people are reading too much into it let's quickly recap all that has been going on in Piper's life and I promise you all these guesses will make sense Piper literally doesn't have friends right now remember she's fallen out with all of her friends from the squad and they've been leaving her one after the other while fans might be really sad about the group falling apart nobody has felt it more than Piper who is all by herself now it's like she's carrying the weight all on her own such an experience can leave anyone feeling really sad judging by her current YouTube videos you can easily tell that there's a shift none of her friends want to shoot videos with her anymore and if you've been Piper's fan since back in the day you don't have to look too far to see it's so unlike her to feature her boyfriend Lev and her ex-boyfriend so frequently but guys Piper's friendship isn't the only part of her life that's crumbling unlike most kids who run up to their parents when they feel alone Piper doesn't get the warmth and comfort of a mother's hug if anything Piper's mother is the main reason why her friends have left her don't forget Piper's friends have accused Tiffany of very ugly things and inappropriate behavior when they were on set being sued for 22 million dollars should already tell you how serious the allegations are for the longest time Piper's mom has been the center of controversy regarding how she treated Piper's friends and even Piper herself she used to make them wear revealing clothes even when they didn't really feel comfortable do you guys remember when she was called out for exploiting Piper like in this clip where she made her pose in a provocative bikini because Tiffany Piper's mom used to criticize and make fun of previous Squad members about their bodies some fans think that Piper might be on this journey to lose weight because her mom does the same to her and that would be the most awful thing ever so you see Piper has no friends or family to talk to or just someone to hang out with to make matters worse she's also been thrown into this awful lawsuit imagine your former friends suing you and you're only 15. guys remember we're talking about someone who's usually out and about having fun with friends and always ready for new adventures Piper is literally a little Explorer always trying new things and being super social so yeah there's a chance that Piper doesn't know what to do when she's all by herself it's like she's trying to figure out how to fill up her time when there's no one else around so it makes sense that people would be worried about her newly found Adventure could Piper's weight loss be linked to the roller coaster of emotions that life has thrown her way we've all been there and we've all resorted to different things to help us cope some teens might turn to unhealthy Habits Like overeating or avoiding food altogether when they're stressed While others might spend excessive time on screens or isolate themselves from friends and family could it be that she's navigating the ups and downs of friendships dealing with the squad's Fallout or even just juggling things on the home front as the saying goes when life gives you lemons you might end up shedding some pounds while making lemonade too but wait there's another side to this Saga and it's the positive change it could be that Piper has decided to step into this new lifestyle that prioritizes Wellness wholesome diets and embracing a strict workout routine I mean it's not uncommon for young stars like Piper to inspire their peers with their determination to live their best lives both inside and out those kale salads and gym sessions are the real secret behind stunning Transformations you know furthermore YouTubers and influencers always feel the need to evolve when they feel their content is beginning to get boring or predictable maybe Piper has revealed this new side of her as a way of keeping her fans interested in something new she's actually getting a lot of compliments on her transformation to the point that some people are requesting if she can train them others have taken her progress as a challenge to also start a fitness journey I want her to be my trainer gonna try this okay loves we've taken a good look at the situation from different sides but let's consider another possible reason behind Piper's weight loss Journey remember Piper only shares these videos on her special account and her fans have to pay to watch them now here's the interesting part most of her fans are around her age teenagers like her and you know teens often struggle with how they feel about their bodies so if someone they really like and follow like Piper is showing them how to lose weight they might want to watch those videos too especially if they think the changes can happen super fast that's why they quickly noticed how Piper's body changed all of a sudden Piper might turn out to be the face of fitness and healthy living among her peers and if she can authentically prove that Fitness and Nutrition are all you need to look that good she might as well make money out of it so let's not forget the fact that she might be eyeing the lucrative opportunities in the wellness industry the main thing about Piper's transformation that's reassuring her fans is that at least she's doing it the right way breaking a sweat fueling up with the good stuff and embracing a healthy lifestyle most people are convinced Piper's journey is all about self-love and empowerment no matter why Piper is doing this let's all hope she's feeling good mentally it's awesome to see young people taking care of themselves and if this is her new thing at 15 then way to go Piper she's all about wellness and that's pretty cool keep shining Piper remembers loves change as normal as we grow whether Piper's changes are because she's faced tough things decided to be healthier or a bit of both what really matters is the happiness she's showing however considering all the drama with her mom her friends and everything that's been going on in Piper's life there is also a possibility Piper's transformation is a coping mechanism and that's why the fans are worried about her drastic weight loss what do you think about Piper's astonishing transformation are you loving her fresh look or should we be worried do you have your own theories about her journey I'd love to hear your thoughts down below also loves if you're curious about what Piper had to say when her friends left the squad click here and watch

07/28/2023,Alabama Barker CAN’T Come Back From This.. (Says N-Word..),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wL0qFMlMD0,177-11, I did not tag him on Tick Tock because I did not love my hair hey loves Alabama shocking and how do you know this well it only took one online Scandal to shatter the sweet soft-spoken image she portrays online you might you might sip slowly because this tea is piping hot I'm about to show you the shocking reality of Alabama Barker's glamorous world and if you know me you know I have all the receipts too we've unraveled the secrets behind her glittering facade and trust me you won't believe the lengths people go to to hide their authentic personalities just for fame and followers all right let me fill you in on how Alabama barkers picture perfect life took a dramatic turn and left Tick-Tock buzzing it all ignited when she reached out to this guy who is a super super talented La based hair stylist to do hair but that wasn't the drama the service fee would come to two thousand dollars apparently Alabama negotiated a deal to pay half of the fees in cash and half in promo Nicholas the hair stylist actually agreed to this because Alabama has a very huge social media following and this partnership would work to his advantage on top of the online shout outs Alabama even said she would attend a red carpet event and a TV show and would vent the hair stylist on all of these platforms too basically how influencers work guys this would have been very good exposure for Nicholas after assessing everything he agreed to do the job hoping that Alabama would hold her end of the bargain lo and behold would you believe that Alabama never did any of these things they agreed upon literally silent She only mentioned the stylist in one picture but no tags no promos nothing like she went on with her life and even had the audacity to take cute pictures in her new platinum blonde hair but never acknowledged the hair stylist as a green a couple of months later one of Nicholas's friends sent him the Star Magazine front page showcasing the world's richest kids and you guessed right Alabama's face was right there things started heating up when the guy took to Tick-Tock and talked about the whole Saga he just gave the story without mentioning her name a few months ago this influence to reached out to me wanted me to do her hair and I was totally down I'm like yeah sure let's do it when it came time to talk about prices but she was asking me for half off in Return of our promotional post so I accepted to do a half off for a promo that never arrived again for something that she never delivered because she just tagged me in a picture but she never mentioned me no stories and no mention just a tag but this person was mentioned in a magazine cover as one of the richest kids in the world in the world and it did not take long before unified who Nick who Nick was talking about by 11 magazine Now by process of elimination we know it's not Jennifer Anderson because as a seasoned celebrity she probably has her own colorist and we know it's not Princess Caroline because again she lives in the UK we know it's not Blue Ivy because again she normally rocks braids and not blonde hair now Angelina Jolie's child goes by they them pronouns I believe and has short brown hair and honey the only person left on this magazine cover is Alabama Barker and here is what his section looks like the audacity to ask for half off is crazy every Rich client I've ever had they are the ones that ask for discounts and don't tip money obviously doesn't mean they are classy don't ever undercut your services you're worth it the irony is that the richest people always get discounts and or free services slash products while everyone else pays full price he is not complaining about his work he is complaining that she did not uphold her end of the bargain and in less than 24 hours the video had over 2 million views I don't know about you all loves but if it was me I wouldn't have responded if I was Alabama remember the guy never mentioned her he just told the story so this is this as you said in a story a long time ago I would have never guessed I started following you waiting for this tea however against her better judgment Alabama made a four-minute response video which escalated the situation even further here's us talking about the promo deal he never once said no to it not only did he not say no to it even after my hair was done and after we did the promo deal he never texted me complaining the only thing he's done is bring it to social media he hasn't come to me mind you this is a grown man he hasn't even said hey will you send me this much money because I feel like I didn't get enough recognition so first of all Alabama said many things and nothing at the same time but what upset people was that she couldn't see her mistake in all of these in fact according to her the hair stylist should have contacted her privately if he wasn't satisfied with how the partnership went the same Alabama that took pictures and videos obsessing about her blonde hair and now turned around and said she didn't see the need to proceed with the partnership because she didn't like the hair guys according to this screenshot she actually liked it to make matters worse Nicholas actually reached out to her privately requesting her to do a tick tock shout out which she agreed to but in her response video she blatantly lies that they never had such a conversation in her long response video she categorically says how much she never liked the hair because it had two shades of wand and that she even booked a second appointment where she was willing to pay full price to get the job done she never honored those appointments as you'll see later in the video she said that the top was platinum blonde while the bottom was complete silver blonde with which wasn't what she wanted in the first place but here's the thing loves you can never go too far with a lie in this screenshot era and I'll share with you the evidence in a second by this time not only was Nicholas annoyed but his craft had also been disrespected so he came out with screenshots of all the conversations they've had and people didn't have to look far to read into Alabama's lies she had also intentionally left out very Vital Information in her insincere response but what's worse was how she shifted the blame first of all remember how she said she never liked the result Nicholas had this to say It was kind enough not to mention your name but now that you started let's get deep into it and now you love you repeat it several times that you were not happy with the result this says otherwise don't color of the hair nobody has everything is so bright already I wasn't extremely happy with the results I love the color of the hair um someone is is definitely lying here or deliberately leaving out some details okay moving on Nicholas had a very genuine question for Alabama if you didn't like my services why did you keep trying to book with me also what's funny is that you hated it so much that you keep trying to book with me not one not two not three not four but five times at this juncture sure pieces of the puzzle had come together and that's when people started grilling Alabama even more the little rich girl could have paid full price but wanted to do a half in exchange for a promo he did what he was supposed to do and she didn't doesn't matter how old she is she needs to be held accountable if she wanted a discount she should have just gone to her stepmom Courtney for a hookup I'm sure they have plenty of Hair people that would work with her and give her a discount for being Courtney's stepdaughter Alabama kept repeating that Nicholas was an adult a man and that he shouldn't have come after her like that and she might have thought that stressing that part would make people sympathize with her but it didn't take too long for her to realize that Tick Tock users were serving her more Humble Pie Guys things took such a dramatic turn for Alabama that she made a tough call of disabling her Tick Tock comments and guess what as we speak her account has gone private the storm is real if you thought we we're done uh that's just the tip of the iceberg loves well the first bit of this drama just sheds light on the situation there's still another part that Nicholas served us he literally took us back to the beginning where Alabama was the first to DM him saying how much he was obsessed with his work can you guys imagine that all of this started over a year ago after listening to what Nicholas had to say people were more convinced that Not only was Alabama ungrateful but she also disregarded other people's time my goodness the number of times she booked appointments with Nicholas but never showed up or communicated prior take a look at this screenshot where he sacrificed to meet with her on a Saturday which was his day off she canceled at the last minute and rescheduled for Sunday Alabama never showed up on the said Sunday and her excuse was that her father didn't wake her up all this time the hair stylist was still being very pleasant y'all the receipts are numerous clearly Alabama didn't show all these Nicholas went ahead to address the people who were asking him why he didn't respond to her private since Alabama had pointed that out and it turns out he actually did in these long paragraphs and for everybody saying like oh you should have talked to her you should have talked to her I did this was my response a year ago these are some long messages so I'm not gonna be reading everything but I pretty much expressed her how I felt when she didn't deliver when she canceled me on my free day when she didn't show up um when she made me lose all the money I told her that she doesn't have any empathy that she doesn't understand how people that actually work and here I show her the screenshots when I cancel my other clients for her to come and never show up most people have empathized with Nicholas the receipts I'm so glad you said everything you said professionalism is out the window after this some people even drive to Courtney into her stepdaughter Shenanigans Kourtney Kardashian your loser stepdaughter owes this man I am so sorry this happened to you I'm a hairdresser as well and I completely understand I commend you for being so brave to speak out because loves just when we thought we had seen it all Alabama's mother also entered the chat at apparently she reached out to Nicholas after he first did Alabama's hair do you remember the hair that she said she didn't like yes that one Alabama and her mom were so impressed that she also contacted Nicholas but it gets more interesting she also wanted her hair done for free you can't make this stuff up y'all it is actually true that the Apple doesn't fall far from the tree so if I'm getting this right according to these screenshots Alabama's mother wanted Nicholas to work on her hair for free a service that would take him well up to nine hours without even a bathroom break or time to eat but when he declined she suddenly couldn't imagine sitting in a chair for nine hours these people if you're wondering what their obsession with free things is honestly you're not alone some people are also just as curious I've watched all the videos I'm definitely on your side and why do they want freebies like isn't this your bread and butter why do these rich people want free or discounted Services your work is amazing never discount or a comedy uh yeah damn even the mama when Nicholas went Full Throttle on his expose he did have a lot of things to say as expected people will always take sides in the situation and this drama also had divided opinions while a majority were on the hairdresser's side some insisted that he was using Alabama's name for clout yet he was a grown man engaging in an online battle with a kid how are you saying you would love to move on and then drag this  on she gave you the promo on Insta like you agree no some even called him out for charging too much for his Services others came to the hair stylist defense on the price issue saying that Alabama comes from a wealthy family and is pretty rich herself now that she's doing her thing on social media they mentioned that 2K on here might be too much for an average person but just pocket change for Alabama Additionally the hairdresser in question works with celebrities and he's well known in Beverly Hills if you scroll through his page you can tell that he is so good at his job but there's one piece of the puzzle that will help us know who is wrong in this situation guys this isn't the first time Alabama is being exposed for mistreating service providers there's yet another video of a nail technician detailing how Alabama bailed out at the last minute yet she drove all the way to Alabama's hotel to offer her Services Alabama was the one who dm'd her in the first place and she says how disappointed she was since her day was already planned out Alabama didn't respond after she arrived and never said anything ever again not even an apology there were so many comments accusing Alabama of mistreating other service providers hinting at a pattern of Deceit and arrogance My Nail Tech did her nails twice and my nail tech hates her because she's grimy apparently my nail tech is the sweetest at this point most people are of the opinion that Alabama Barker needs to do better honestly Alabama Barker had her fair share of online Heat this year isn't it just a few months ago when she received backlash for black fishing this came after she posted a video rapping in red hair one Twitter user even said I don't understand how white girls be rich and decide to do this the way I would be at a pool spending money somewhere like that she even had to bring down a video where her friend said the n-word anyways loves I would love to hear your opinion on this situation down

07/24/2023,Piper Rockelle SPEAKS OUT Why Everyone Left The Squad,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcGgkUkQryY,175-11, Piper account's friends are leaving her one by one and the lack of people in her Squad is starting to become really sad and while some of it can be blamed on her mom she is also the reason for so much of this drama and she's had a lot to say about it looking at Piper's YouTube channel it seems like no one really wants to be in her videos anymore since most of her content recently has been with her boyfriend Lev and her ex-boyfriend Gavin you can really tell that she's getting desperate with the way that she involves her ex all the time especially in front of her boyfriend but it's starting to look like they have no other choice and there have even been rumors that Gavin might be leaving Piper as well to pursue his musical career for good now the reason a lot of Piper's Squad members left her is actually all because of her mother Tiffany Smith who's been accused of some very serious things against these kids because guys she's actually being sued for 22 million dollars by 11 of Piper's ex-squad members and it's a big deal the trial was initially supposed to be held a few months ago but now it's been pushed to November where all of this is really going to escalate the reason a lot of these people left is because they felt extremely uncomfortable being in Piper's house and her mom was the reason for it the mother of YouTube Star Piper rockelle who has over 10 million subscribers despite being only 15 years old is facing multiple awful allegations that she physically and emotionally abused children including touching them and doing all kinds of other nasty things Tiffany has been accused of exposing these kids to emotional distress harassment and even abuse while they were filming for the YouTube channel and it's even been revealed that they were being exploited for all of this without even getting paid there's a lot of information about what she used to put them through before it got too much for them and it turns out that she's been doing this for years even before they even realized how wrong it was for her to be making them do all of these things I think we all know how explicit some of Piper's videos can get with all of the fake dating going on in the inappropriate way they all act with each other and it's looking as if Tiffany is behind all of it and she's the one demanding for these kids to do these adult things it's something that affected all of them so much that they decided it was too much and they had to leave but this is probably affecting Piper the most since she's being put through the same kind of treatment and yet she can't really leave since her mom is literally all she has honestly according to court documents Tiffany loved to put these kids in the most uncomfortable positions just so they could get more views out of them and they literally didn't even have a choice she'd make the girls dress as revealing as possible no matter how uncomfortable they were with it Tiffany would always tell me to go up into Piper's closet and get something that's more tight and revealing Sophie Ferguson Piper's ex-best friend even revealed that she was only 11 or 12 When Tiffany forced her to dress in a towel and pretend to be naked for a thumbnail there are some real creeps out there on the internet and this mother was making a literal child pretend to be naked for click bait even the guys had to deal with this sort of thing since she'd always ask them to take their shirts off because sex sells Tiffany was seriously terrorizing these kids sometimes and they came out to say that sometimes they would be chased around the house by her while she was yelling inappropriate things at them and even holding them down while touching them inappropriately Rhys Piper's cousin revealed that she was cornered by Tiffany and asked if she had done it and even told that she should do it she'd touch all the way up her legs and even held her down one time to rub a broom handle in her face telling her that it was a smelly yes Claire Piper's other cousin was even spat in the face one time while Tiffany was on top of her and she always got poked and prodded while having to hear comments about her breasts it's really sick and a huge reason why Piper's own cousins refused to even be in the videos anymore however as I mentioned before her mom's behavior isn't the only reason so many people left since in group drama also had a lot to do with it in fact Simone Aiden and Connor two of Piper's original Squad members left the squad because of Piper's ex Gavin ever since Piper and love got together Piper kept dangling Gavin in front of the camera for views and her friends were getting real tired of it it started off with Piper and Gavin acting extremely comfortable with each other on Tick Tock to the point where it started looking very inappropriate for two people who were not dating in fact fans started to suspect that Piper was cheating on love with Gavin I think Lev is too good a boyfriend for Piper he deserves a girl who loves and respects him hashtag love deserves better I bet Piper would be mad if love did something similar like this with another girl aren't y'all each other's ex a lot of people started to seriously doubt who Piper was even in a relationship with because of it and guys it even looks like Gavin might have wanted Piper to break up with cleb in a video he even looked like he was going to show a picture of the two when asked about a couple that should break up Hold Up Wait A Minute something ain't right cause then I start to taste I said and then I start to smell them so it's like a smell that tastes like so I knew something was wrong I knew something special about Piper and Gavin also just spent a lot of time together and made tick tocks together all the time and she even showed up with a hickey on her belly in one of those videos I wanna take you home straight and when fans noticed the hickey he actually liked the comments talking about it which more than confirms it is it just me or does Piper have a hickey on the side of her stomach this behavior is why Simone and Connor couldn't stand to be in the squad anymore since they actually had a lot of history with Gavin and if he joined the squad they were out mainly because they had actually been in Gavin's old Squad and had to deal with a lot of bad from him and his mom Teresa Sophie's Uncle actually revealed all of this on a live stream he did where he decided to talk all about why the squad members were leaving and he mentioned how Tiffany and Teresa were at fault for most of it but that they also could not stand Gavin Gavin's about to go to uh Parker Squad and that's probably why a bunch of them left Teresa is the worst person I've ever dealt with Tiffany's the second worst person I didn't want Sophie to go to the go fam ever even Piper brought it up in a video Once where she confirmed that they left because of her and Gavin and she even shot took full responsibility for it my members left it is actually because about reuniting with gas and I even told them that I would not reunite with Gavin if they did not leave the squad they didn't really listen to that they still left this is all my fault and I really wish that I could change things however fans pointed out that they have a very good reason for leaving and it wasn't just because they were mad at Piper like she was making it out to be Piper had literally brought someone back into their lives who they were basically traumatized by Simone and Connor laughed because of what happened with Gavin's family back then and they don't want to go through that again fans were also pretty shocked by this whole thing because these were some of Piper's oldest friends and she was giving up for a guy anyways guys Piper has overall been a pretty bad friend to her Squad members since she's even been accused of leaving Eliana out of things and purposely driving her out of the squad this not only seemed to happen off camera but it even made it into her videos one major instance was when Piper decided it would be funny to prank Eliana by pretending that everyone hated her just for views oh my God and this was especially messed up because it was pretty clear to a lot of people that this was something that Eliana was experiencing for real in the group and Piper was just borderline mean about it y'all in the video there are so many Clips where you can tell that Eliana was for real heart by this and none of them even thought to end the prank and tell her that it was a joke okay I'm not like upset and to no one's surprise Eliana did end up leaving the squad for good after all of this happened and from some leaked DMS Piper really didn't like Eliana well I'm done and then Ellie was in there being a smartass I only want to be in Piper chats from now on don't add me to any others I'm not replacing her she makes her own decisions from the same DMS she practically also revealed that the squad was completely falling apart I don't have a squad anymore I have friends and she even seemed to throw some shade at those who left the squad who she didn't consider her friends anymore and if my friend want to come and support me and meet you guys then they are more than welcome to attend and y'all the girls are fighting in this one Piper's ex-friends have since come out to call Piper out for her behavior in some very cryptic Tick Tock Piper initially posted this Tick Tock where she seemed to call out her ex-friends for lying on her name and then they all decided to get back at her using the same Trend while exposing some of the things that she had done to them and it got messy Claire and Sophie even had an entire video where they talked about how they were both betrayed by someone which everyone could easily guess was Piper and they basically bonded over being wronged by her but guys this was actually a pretty big shock since when Sophie left the squad Claire was still there with Piper so Claire had basically gone to the enemy side to shade on Piper but they bonded a lot over it since they basically went through the same thing with Piper and they were both betrayed by her it's pretty clear that all the drama was affecting all of their mental health badly which seems to be the main reason they all left and Emily Dobson even admitted that it was genuinely in her best interest to distance herself from the squad and even her parents could see it I'm just spending time on my own for a while the squad videos haven't been the best for my feelings and my parents want me to step back a bit after this was revealed Emily even unfollowed Piper on Tick Tock wanting as much distance as possible and basically disappeared from the squad however guys it gets so much worse than just teen drama since a lot of fans actually suspect that a major reason all of these Squad members are distancing themselves from Piper is because of her defending her mom in the lawsuit When Tiffany was accused of purposely making the kids do inappropriate things and even making Piper wear a bikini for one video Piper actually stepped up to defend her mom by saying doesn't make me do anything and that pictures of teenagers in bikinis having fun are not sexual they're only sexual if you view us that way this was pretty shocking to hear since it feels like Piper doesn't want to stand up for her friends who are now literally suing her mom and it's no wonder they chose to leave in fact as I said at the start it's even starting to look like Gavin might be leaving the squad since he actually just signed a contract to a new record label and deleted all the old content from his Instagram he made a huge deal out of it and even disappeared for a few days after unfollowing both lab and Piper on Instagram fans started to suspect that this might mean that he was leaving the squad all before he announced his new music career however after all that drama he's actually back to following them again probably to cause not too much drama but it does look like he's serious about pursuing his music career so we might be seeing less and less of him on Piper's Channel this means that even if he is done with everything that Piper and her mom have put everyone through we might start to see the end of Piper Raquel and guys if he really does leave then that would mean she genuinely betrayed her friends for absolutely no reason and started this entire domino effect that just might end her career anyways loves what do you guys think about what Piper is doing let me know down below and don't forget to check out this other video for more tea
07/17/2023,What Actually Happened To Gavin Magnus?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5cjwMgTmU4,172-11,y'all Gavin Magnus has seemingly gone crazy he has not only unfollowed Piper and live on Instagram which fans think could mean he's leaving the squad for good but he also made his fans think he went missing or had actually died just for a song promotion I hope they think I'm dead I hope they think of deceased why so the comeback's even crazier than like he's alive you know what I mean Crash and Burn it's all or nothing this might be the worst promo for music you've ever done just kidding this is so fun and cool I love the assumptions fans were seriously worried for Gavin because of his cryptic Behavior a few days ago and just going on his YouTube account showed that something was really wrong every single video he's ever posted had his thumbnail replaced with the word psycho in bloody red letters and it was seriously worrying fans even his last normal video had its title changed to Psycho which has nothing to do with the actual video which originally was about him and Piper doing a crazy shopping challenge the bio is still the same in the video content is the same but the name and the thumbnail got changed and then over on his Instagram he deleted all of his posts a few days ago and posted a video of him in the studio singing as well as another psycho picture with the caption fell Outta EXO love at first glance this did look like a song promo to me which it kind of is but what he was actually doing was building up to the fact that he got signed to a record label big noise but y'all he literally gave his fans the biggest scare with the way that he was promoting this and it is not okay after days of build up he posted this video to Instagram revealing the big news and let's just say that fans were not happy you literally freaked out your fans who are all just kids just to Hype up some songs like find a better way to promote it's pretty messed up since he actually managed to convince some fans that he's been hacked or even passed away this really weird stuff happened when he went live for only 6 minutes and 30 seconds and it was just an empty room with his guitar on the bed it's honestly creepy enough as it is but then he also pinned a comment saying R.I.P which is why some fans believed he might have passed away or that he was planning on it people are freaking out about it on basically all platforms since no one seemed to be able to reach him guys it's Gavin I don't know why he would do something like that on his story you can see the window in the background however things got even scarier when his mom actually decided to go on the live and comment come home which had a lot of people very concerned it raised a lot of questions since he genuinely made it look like he ran away especially by bringing his mom into it some people even suggested that he was playing a big prank on everyone but the mom thing made it look uncomfortably real in fact she even posted on her Instagram story putting out a missing person statement for him it's actually so crazy she wrote If you or anyone you know has information text us and even linked a phone number and even if it was a song announcement or a prank a lot of people thought it was super messed up to joke around like that and make such a big deal out of something so serious and guys some fans even became genuinely worried for him because they think it might have something to do with Piper and he's having some kind of mental breakdown especially because he actually unfollowed almost everyone he knows when this first started including Piper and lab which a lot of people assumed meant he was leaving the squad for Judd he seriously made it look like something really bad had happened and since we don't really know what the song is about it could definitely be possible that it talks about his experience with the squad along with the rip messages and the Bloody words he also posted till we meet again on his Instagram story and was even ghosting his friends since one of his friends Giada couldn't seem to reach him at all it's hard to say if she was also in on it or not but if she wasn't then I seriously feel bad for her he also posted some very cryptic messages on threads where he said I died the 13th We Say Goodbye the world can be dark Goodbye World and last three red you'll see all of which sounds incredibly concerning I can't be the only one that thinks that he took this way too far and worrying a lot of people just for a song doesn't really sound like the best business move in fact a lot of people even think he might have been hacked which has probably cost him a lot of subscribers and followers and guys some people even speculate that Tiffany Smith might have something to do with the song and after everything that's come out about her and how she's been treating the kids working with Piper I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being about something like that it would actually be a pretty big deal if it really is about that since Gavin initially denied everything about Tiffany being inappropriate or abusing them but according to a tick tock user Gavin actually mentioned a lot of what she's been accused of when he was much younger but a lot of fans are speculating that he had a valid reason to lie he probably wants to protect Piper because he knows what her mom treats her like off camera however since he and Piper broke up and he unfollowed her on Instagram it might mean that he's fully ready to tell the truth about what happened to him and support the other ex-squad members who are currently suing Tiffany for what she did to them as of right now Gavin didn't reveal any release date for the song so it might take a while to see what could possibly justify this kind of behavior from him but he did upload a YouTube video where he kind of addresses all of this foreign just searching everywhere looking for Gavin I have no idea where he is he started the video off by making it look like he had runaway or was missing and for no reason because he then goes on to explain that he's fine and that actually nothing happened to him anyways as if that wasn't bad enough he actually seemed like he was making fun of his fans worrying about him even his mom seems to be very against the idea of doing that to your fan base yet he didn't seem to care at all his mom even read some comments of people worrying out loud and he didn't seem concerned or even bothered by it in fact he just brushed past it and started talking about garlic salt you guys he was not taking any of it seriously at all and the whole video was about them getting ready to meet with the company and then go out to dinner with them to officially sign the contract but they do reveal that psycho is going to be one of his songs a crowd favorite apparently and they also mentioned the other song titles that he's presumably going to be releasing honestly I'm not sure what to think either since it looks like he's been recently around Piper so if it is about her mom it might be more of a subtle call out since he wouldn't want to get in trouble it seems like the company was genuinely super excited to sign him to their label as well as they definitely praised him a lot and this seems like a very professional company and it's hard to imagine that it was their idea to do this kind of marketing so hopefully his next campaign will be less scary and ominous and it honestly looks like his fans weren't too happy with this video response either since while there were a lot of congratulations in his comment section A lot of fans also expressed how genuinely scared they were we were worried about you Gavin and we're so proud of you I was so worried I'm glad you're okay and congrats I'm so glad you're back I was so worried and I thought you got hacked or something I thought you got hacked or dead I was going to cry don't do that again I'm so happy to see you it's just as bad over on Tick Tock as well after all the Shady things he posted he posted a random Tick Tock of him messing around with a filler instead of acknowledging any of it and the people were very confused his entire comment section is basically just people thinking he had died or that he went missing and some people are even accusing him of having done it all for clout which I guess isn't really wrong it's hard to say what could have possibly made him think any of this was actually good marketing but if this song is about what people think it's about then all the crazy stuff might add up when we see the song anyways loves what do you think about him scaring his fans like this let me know in the comments and don't forget to check out this other video for more drama 
07/12/2023,Why Piper Rockelle’s Mom Is Being Sued For $22M.. THIS IS BAD,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hrjZIddE7E,164-15,Piper Raquel's mom Tiffany Smith is so bad that people want to see her behind bars Piper's ex-squad members are in fact suing her for over 20 million dollars in emotional damage and the stuff they've exposed about her is absolutely terrifying all these happy kids when like behind the scenes that's not how we all were we're stressed out crying and being in these videos because you're yelling at us and it's not it's not fair let me start by saying that Piper's Channel content is anything but innocent since these kids are more often than not put through uncomfortable situations with each other and it's mostly based on dating and Tiffany could get seriously inappropriate with these kids even on camera you are so hot you see hardcore rushes dirty to her in Russian and let's just say that they've had enough and finally decided to speak up about what's really been going on behind the scenes but they didn't do it by making a tweet or a YouTube video exposing Tiffany no no they went to actual lawyers it's that bad you guys and it's clear that they want the whole world to know what really happened as well this isn't something that's being kept behind closed doors and they all seem to be very open about what really happens to them during a normal work day and it's not just some of them either 11 of them decided to stand up and do what's right and they all used to be a part of the piper Squad so these aren't just random people who appeared in a random video it's actually Sawyer charbino download doer Corinne Coy Connor Kane Simone Harrison Aiden mikas Hayden Hass Walker Bryant Sophia Fergie and even Piper's cousins Claire and Rhys Rocksmith and you guys all of these kids have appeared on Piper's YouTube for years and they've all revealed that they had to go through some horrible treatment for content the lawsuit is basically all about how they had to go through years of emotional distress harassment molestation and abuse the group actually filed a lawsuit all the way back in January of 2022 and it is still going all of the kids are asking for two million dollars each and the lawsuit is directed towards both Tiffany and her boyfriend Hunter Hill who is supposedly the director and editor of Piper's channel so while you might think that the channel is Pipers from the content and the name alone it's very clear that Piper has next to no say when it comes to what happens in the videos and while the lawsuit has been filed more than a year ago the trial date is actually set for the 6th of November and that's if it doesn't get delayed once again since the original trial date was set around April this year y'all I even have taken a look at the official court documents and when I tell you it's bad it's bad not only did Tiffany Force these kids to do all these inappropriate and even dangerous things but they also were never paid anything for it these kids had to show up for full work days and be a part of this YouTube channel while also having their own channels yet they were never paid and were just expected to keep doing it and not only that but they were actually charged several hundred dollars a month by Tiffany's boyfriend Hunter for the use of his editing skills on their own channels you cannot be serious these kids basically made Piper's Channel what it is today since we all know that it wouldn't be as popular without all the drama within the group and without all the fake couples being paraded around so not only were they exploiting these kids but they even expected them to pay for it and their nightmare doesn't even end there since if they decided to leave on their own Tiffany and Hunter would go out of their way to full-on sabotage their individual channels apparently they would try their best to drive down their subscriber count and Views by using Bots falsely reporting inappropriate content and probably who knows which other tactics this genuinely led to a lot of their videos getting restricted which obviously directly impacts their already lacking income honestly I wouldn't be surprised if it was revealed that they made fake accounts going around spreading false rumors about these kids now getting into what Tiffany actually put the kids through it's safe to say that being inappropriate with them is a major understatement the list of things this woman did to these kids genuinely goes from A to Z and it is horrifying Tiffany would talk about the boy's private parts and she'd be very explicit about it she even had the nickname Dwayne the Rock Hard Johnson for one of the boys nether regions and she'd often say it I'm getting uncomfortable just talking about it honestly anyways she'd also pretend to be Lenny the dead cat and literally chase the kids around the house while shouting inappropriate and graphic things at them like I'm going to touch you in your sleep and yeah little girl slash boy let's make you let's kiss and those are the less sexual phrases Tiffany would also encourage them to be more explicit with each other on camera and would even teach them how to properly date and crush on each other and she even went as far as trying to pressure Walker into being more aggressive aggressive and physical with her own daughter so that their relationship would appear more real she'd do this kind of thing to all of them and would even go as far as forcing them to dress more skimpy for views this kind of behavior is actually something about the ex-squad addressed in a video interview they did where the girls especially talked about how they were forced to dress inappropriately Tiffany would always tell me to go up into Piper's closet and get something that's more tight and revealing Sophie even revealed that she was only 11 or 12 When Tiffany made her pose in a towel for the camera and let me not even get started on how she makes her own daughter dress I think we've all seen that she'd go as low as making her walk around in a bikini for no reason and guys not even the guys were safe from this kind of behavior since she would apparently often ask them to take their shirts off because sells Tiffany would actually often ask the kids about sex and one time when she asked Reese if she had done it she said well I think you should and if that wasn't bad enough she was also practically forcing herself on her like touching her all the way up her leg and rubbing a broom handle in her face while telling her it was Lenny's big smelly piece Claire wasn't free from this Behavior either since she'd also slide her hand up her legs and would even spank her poke her through her clothes and comment on how big her breasts were one time she even spit on her face while she was on top of her let me remind you guys that these are her nieces unfortunately all this inappropriate behavior wasn't just behind closed doors since it's also been revealed that Tiffany once took Corinne with her to the post office where she then mailed Piper's used underwear to someone unknown Tiffany even told Corinne that old men like to smell this stuff guys I can't even begin to process how disgusting that is and I can't even imagine how Piper must have felt hearing what her mom was doing this kind of behavior was obviously incredibly wrong and I'm sure the kids realized while it was happening but since these are kids were talking about we really can't blame them for not taking immediate action but since coming out with all of this they've been able to discuss why exactly it took so long and Corinne even brought up the fact that it's important for them to speak up so other kids can see this kind of treatment is very wrong I feel like it's important to come forward because other kids who might think this is normal um it's not there's like being overly stabilized at a young age being told to say things do things wear things for the appeal of YouTube and for people to click on it more which is just absolutely disgusting anyways loves it's pretty clear that these kids suffered through a lot and to no one's surprise this whole thing had a massive impact on their mental health even the parents have come out to say how much their kids have suffered and it's honestly bordering PTSD and what really saddens me is that some of the moms actually admitted that they had no idea what their kids were being put through behind the scenes but are extremely upset with the way Tiffany behaved I'm mortified by what she's done to other children Jennifer Bryant is Walker's mother it needs to be exposed and she needs to be held responsible for what she's doing Stevia Rico is Kareem Joy's mom I 100 think that Tiffany exploited our children for monetary gain Walker's mom Jennifer also mentioned that her goal with the lawsuit is that Tiffany never gets to work with a child ever again something that I am sure every other parent can agree on even Ashley and Rocksmith Claire and Reese's mom has said that she just wants peace for her kids and it's clear that she wishes they had never gotten involved with Piper and her Squad and she even specifically said I want all predators who hurt young kids to be brought to Justice the kids also all admitted that they lost their childhood to this and a lot of them even had to leave social media in order to take control over their lives again all of our innocence was just swiped from us it is genuinely so heartbreaking because all of the kids innocently joined this team so that they could have fun but it turned into an all-around nightmare for them something they never could have expected I didn't joined the squad because I wanted money and fame yeah I joined the squad because I thought I was gonna have friends but even with everything that happened the kids aren't actually blaming Piper herself for any of it and they even believe that she was equally taken advantage of I believe that Piper is a victim did nothing it's Piper is completely innocent it's all Tiffany unfortunately guys it doesn't sound like Piper agrees since she's actually come out to say that her mom doesn't make me do anything and she even defended the fact that her mom asked her to wear a swimsuit for the camera and said that it was all because it was summer and hot outside she also mentioned that kids in swimsuits are inherently sexual pictures of teenagers in bikinis having fun are not sexual they're only sexual if you view us that way and while she's completely right it's hard to look past the fact that all the kids have accused Tiffany of purposely making them dress inappropriately to drive up views so while it's not inherently sexual Piper's mom could have unfortunately meant for it to be these responses actually came out after Piper spoke up about the issue and directly called out Piper's mom for using her and the kids around her they actually made a public tweet on the issue saying how many kids like Piper Raquel are being exploited by their parents and at what point do the rest of us say this isn't okay for 13 year old to be posing in a bikini while her mother takes the photo but at the same time all Piper's mom had to say in order to defend herself was that she was just a mom who would do anything for her daughter and guys pink is obviously not alone in their criticism and a lot of people have come out to say how terrible it is that Piper and her friends were being put through this I feel so bad for Piper Raquel she is 15 and is making adult themed videos and being hyper sexualized online shame on her mom for knowingly catering to an audience a lot of people have even pointed out that Tiffany has even convinced Piper that what she's doing isn't wrong which is so concerning I was just watching videos on this today it's sad that Piper Raquel's mom has emotionally manipulated her enough that she doesn't see anything wrong with her content I think it's safe to say that it really looks like Piper and her mom don't care in the slightest about the fact that they're literally being sued by the X Squad since they're posting videos like nothing's happening and have just brought in new people for the content hopefully there treated better now that everything has come to light but seeing as her video content has stayed the same it's really hard to say anyways loves how do you feel about this whole thing let me know in the comments below and don't forget to check out this other video for more tea foreign
07/09/2023,The Real Reason Why Piper Rockelle’s Friends Left Her..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-z4JLputU,161-11, if Piper Raquel isn't careful she might end up all alone very soon and everyone can see it with the way almost all of her friends have left her because it feels like I am no friends the worst part about it guys is that she obviously hates being alone and yet she keeps pushing her friends away and making them hate her one by one it looks like every single one of her original squad has left the group and most of them never even talk to each other anymore now as you guys know there's been some major issues when it comes to Piper's Squad because of all the Shady work her mom Tiffany Smith was doing behind the scenes but if you're not fully caught up 11 of the kids who used to show up on her Channel have all gotten together to talk about some of the abuse they faced behind the scenes because of Piper's mom the kids accused Tiffany of inflicting emotional physical and even sa for years because she wanted to use them for content by featuring them on Piper's YouTube channel and let's face it you guys this was basically Tiffany's Youtube channel since she practically scripted everything that happened for years being overly stabilized at a young age and um being told to say things do things wear things for the appeal of YouTube and for people to click on it more which is just absolutely disgusting the kids revealed that they experience every kind of harassment from Tiffany and it's no wonder they feel extremely uncomfortable around Piper and her Squad now they accuse her of exposing them to a physical emotional verbal and sometimes simply abusive environment all of this was just swiped from us she would like run around and say sexual things to you they're actually suing for swing first eat but the lawsuit is targeted at Tiffany and her boyfriend Hunter Hill and not Piper considering that Piper is also a victim of all of this and I can't really put any of the blame on her the girls were always forced to wear skimpy clothing for no reason and they all expressed how uncomfortable it made them so I wouldn't be shocked if Piper herself was also extremely uncomfortable by this notion Tiffany would always tell me to go up into Piper's closet and get something that's more tight and revealing but despite the horrible working conditions which none of the kids ever got paid for by the way there is also a whole lot of drama going on between them that caused a lot of the squad members to leave Piper so while what her mom did was absolutely terrible Piper isn't completely blame free by the way that she acted towards some of the people she called her friends one of the big drama moments on Piper's channel is her relationship with her supposed boyfriend Lev and her ex Gavin which has caused a big rift between her and some of her other friends Piper and Gavin had this whole thing where it looked like they still had a thing for each other even though they broke up and got with other people and it was honestly super weird to see since a lot of her fans got extremely confused about whether or not Piper had gotten back together with Gavin or if she was still with love because they were acting so sus y'all I mean Piper was literally accused of cheating on love a bunch of times with the way she was behaving and when Gavin got a new girlfriend everyone thought that Piper was jealous and that she wanted to have him back the worst part about it is that they tried playing it cool by having Gavin introduce his new girlfriend Ava to Piper in a YouTube video and guys not only is it pretty weird to do all of this with your ex but Piper also just seemed extremely uncomfortable with the whole thing it was honestly such an awkward meeting I liked meeting you and I would like to you know meet again we could be like friends or something like friends or something this was a little weird for me because you know I'm talking to my ex-boyfriend about you know the new crush they basically just sat there and were interrogated by Gavin while barely even talking together so I'm not really sure what any of that was supposed to accomplish besides just showing that Piper wasn't as over Gavin as she would like people to believe even people in the comments commented on how things were just off in the video I have a feeling they're gonna get back together I feel like Ava was feeling weird because Piper and the others know more about Gavin and things honestly just got worse from there as Piper and Gavin spent more and more time together and Piper even showed up on camera with what looked like a hickey on her belly while she was hanging out with everyone assumed that this meant something was going on between them how does this not make love uncomfortable and to make matters even worse Gavin actually encouraged everyone who is saying that they might be getting back together by liking a bunch of the comments saying stuff like is it just me or does Piper have a hickey on the side of her stomach and get back together eventually they did make things official between them meaning that they both probably cheated on their partners and the whole thing actually blew a hole in their friend groups and Gavin's presence in the squad actually forced others to leave this was all revealed by Sophie's Uncle who exposed a lot of the behind the scenes secrets and even that Simone and Connor chose to leave the squad because of what Piper was doing with Gavin and because he was officially joining the squad and they were not happy about it Gavin's about to go to a piper Squad and that's probably why a bunch of them left and it makes total sense why they're mad since they actually used to be a part of Gavin Squad and are still on bad terms with him Piper was basically betraying them by bringing him into her Squad and as you all know these were literally some of Piper's oldest friends yet it looks like she didn't care about their feelings at all anyways Piper is no stranger to betrayal since she seems to have betrayed a lot of her friends which is the main reason why they keep leaving her in fact two of these ex-squad members even bonded over the fact that they were backstabbed by Piper Claire and Sophie actually sat down and made an entire video about a backstabber which everyone could quickly figure out was about Piper in the squad the fact that Claire and Sophie stayed friends was a huge shock to fans since Sophie was actually one of Piper's ex-friends while Claire was still friends with Piper which really added to the drama but as it turns out they actually went through very similar situations and could both relate to being turned on someone they could considered a close friend they'll go spreading lies about you I think or this is stuff that actually has happened to me they spread lies about me um to get other people to turn against me because I'm a good person I think what's so hard with like Claire and I is that we've been like any time you get backstabbed it isn't easy like it's like not cool when someone does that but I think what's so hard is that like when you're close to someone and you think that like they're like you know what I mean it's just like it hurts too not only that like I just think it's so hard because we've been backstabbed by so many people to the point where I get backstabbed and I'm like I don't even care because it's like yeah I've been backstabbed so much it doesn't really affect me anymore and let's not forget that when Claire left it was a huge deal since she's literally Piper's cousin and you'd have to do a lot of damage for a family member to leave you it also looks like Emily Dobson had a pretty harsh exit from the squad since the whole thing started affecting her mental health badly some DMS from her were leaked where you can clearly see she was struggling with being in the squad I'm just spending time on my own for a while the squad videos haven't been the best for my feelings and my parents want me to take a step back a bit at the time she claimed she was still friends with Piper but it's hard to say if she still feels that way after everything that's happened Emily even went on to post a public post to her story saying that she's taken an overall break from social media to focus on some things but never directly said that she's leaving the squad which did give some fans hope however we've all seen how the squad members have taken a break in the past just to end up leaving like when Jensen went on his break and never came back so it's very likely that the same thing happened to Emily but it looks like Piper wasn't too happy knowing that people were speculating Emily decided to leave the squad because of all the bad energy and she even blocked an account that was saying that Emily was leaving but guys it looks like the fan might have been right since people have found out that Emily actually unfollowed Piper on Tick Tock which could be exactly what confirms that she's done with the group for good it's very likely that the whole thing with Piper's mom is what pushed her over the edge but the fact that she unfollowed Piper after saying She'll always be friends with her in the DM doesn't sit right with me but I don't know about you guys one thing's for sure you guys and that is the fact that Emily's fans are super happy that she is out of the squad I'm so happy for her she needed to get out of there it was so toxic for her and everyone she's free after three long years this leads me to probably the worst thing Piper has done the person who probably had it the worst was Eliana now Eliana was literally one of her closest friends for years which is why it was so shocking to see Piper treat her the way she did even on camera a lot of people have pointed out that Piper always made fun of Eliana to feel like she was left out and might have even been jealous of her a lot of the time just look at these side eyes that she keeps giving her but Piper was making Eliana feel bad all the time and the number of videos where you can tell Eliana felt left out are shocking y'all she even directly addressed how she felt like she was left out a lot in the past which fans assumed was about the piper Squad try not to make anyone feel excluded basically the things that I've had done to me I'd try not to do them however it gets even worse since Piper actually full-on admitted that she didn't like Eliana some shocking weaked DMS straight up show Piper calling her a smartass and talking about how Eliana made her decision to leave and guys the most shocking thing to me is the fact that it looks like Piper has genuinely been through so much in her life and really depends on her friendships to keep her going she even filmed herself once where she showed how horrible it felt to be isolated from her friends when she had covet it feels like I have no friends so it's kind of insane how she keeps pushing her friends away like this when she's obviously super dependent on people in her life honestly it kind of looks like the whole thing has already blown up in her face since in those same leaked DMS about Eliana she actually said I don't have a squad anymore I have friends so does this mean that she's done trying to monetize her friendships and faking these crazy scenarios for no reason honestly I'm not sure since her content style really hasn't changed but hopefully she'll wake up and realize that she's genuinely hurting her friends with her behavior and if she doesn't do anything about it soon she might just wake up with no friends anyways loves what do you guys think about this mess let me know in the comments and don't forget to check out this other

07/03/2023,What Really Happened To The Gorilla Glue Girl? (NEW Updates),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4igKzB5Nq1U,157-11,Gorilla Glue girl became an internetsensation back in 2021 and as we allknow the whole thing stole month fromher life but even two years later it'sstill affecting her despite the factthat she managed to turn the whole thingaround and even made her own hairproducts people are still sending hercrazy amounts of hate so let's just getinto how Jessica Brown's nightmare hasbeen kept alive all these years and howshe's turned her life around recentlytessica did an interview with the NewYork Post about everything that she'sdealt with ever since she first put theglue in her hair and how it completelychanged her life and she's had a lot tosay about how much the internet'sreactions affected her life in dangerousways when this whole thing first startedtessico was just trying to get cute fora date with her fiance apparently he wasgoing to take her out on a boat ridewhich is why it was absolutely crucialthat the hair stayed in place the issuewas that she had run out of her trustyold got to be hairspray that's a staplefor any hair stylist so she went aroundthe house looking for a replacementwhich is when she found the gorilla glueand I went to go use my got to be gluespray air came out so now I'm runningthrough the house looking for somethingelse that I can use and there it was theGorilla Glue spree just staring me inthe face and I was like it shouldn'thurt but what Jessica wasn't expectingwas exactly how long the hair would stayin place because of the spray apparentlyher reasoning for this whole thing wasthat she actually used Gorilla Glue inher house especially at Christmas timewhere she'd hung up decorations with thespray that usually fell down after a fewdays so she always had to spray it upagain so because of this tessica wasexpecting the glue to easily wash out ofher hair after her night out and itwould all just be a fun memory of herimprovisation skills unfortunately as weall know that is not what happened theglue stayed stuck to her hair creating aliteral helmet and while her hairglamorously stayed in place it wasn'tthe best feeling to have your hair stuckto your head like that testica evenrevealed that she was so embarrassed bythe whole thing that she actually keptit quiet for a whole month where shetried to get rid of it herself I spent30 Days by myself trying to get it out Itried dishwashing liquid I tried babyoil I tried cooking oil I tried Stoutshe even kept it a secret from her ownmom for about a week so she wouldn't getscolded for what she had done buteventually tessica ran out of optionsand that's when her daughter actuallyencouraged her to make a video for ticktock to perhaps get some tips on how toremove it and what happened next issomething none of them could have everimagined she posted this iconic TickTock where she explained everything thathappened to her and how she needed helphey y'all for those of y'all that knowme knowmy hair has been like this for

I'm gonna tell y'all likethis if you ever ever run out of got tobe Blue Spring don't everuse this I think we all saw how thisevent hit the news it was everywhereeveryone was talking about it andeveryone was either super concerned forher or found the whole thing hilariousand tessica was especially confused withhow viral this whole thing went the nextmorning my daughter she's all excitedbut you won't borrow your video has overa million views I'm sitting here likedid anybody say what I can do to getthis off I really just thought it wasgonna be people from my neighborhoodthing you know use this or use that butthis went way beyond my neighborhood butwhatrealize is thisis this hadn't already suffered enoughby dealing with this and she also had tolisten to everyone coming for her it washorrible social media was horrible evenWendy Williams had some pretty uglythings to say about the whole thing likeit's not nothing on here says glue yourhair and then we all look bad becauseshe did that[Music]her hair follicles are dead she can'tshave her hair she can't shave her hairshe shaved her hair she'd gouge out herscalp she'll be wearing wigs for therest of her life but I would imagine nowshe's going to have a Ticky Ticky boomif she wasn't already Ticky boom boomlike she might have something wrong withher or something like that mentally itwas actually so bad that she had tobring her mom in to help her put a stopto it my mama ended up calling WendyWilliams and say Wendy my baby made amistake could you cut us some slack andthat was it never heard from Wendy againand if getting crucified in the mediawasn't enough she even got hate mail toher actual address two days after thevideo went viral I received hate mail tomy house to my address if I was aweak-minded person I probably would havedid what they told me to do and that wasunalive myself I even had a letter sentto my house with a person holding thehead that they had been cut off withholding in the hand and it was reallyeasy for everyone to find her address tosend her these things since Jessica ownsa daycare center that functions out ofher own home people are also completelybaffled to hear that someone would beable to send hate mail this bad tosomeone like her why would a lunaticsend this lady hate mail what I don'tunderstand is why you would send someonehate mail over this but it didn't evenstop at just Anonymous hate since eventhe kids at her Children's School werebeing absolutely horrible about it andeven made her kids cry some kids at mychildren's school made up this horriblesoul and naturally had Mike's to kidscrying shockingly there were even somepeople who tried so hard to make it seemlike tessica was stupid and just didn'tknow how to remove the glue properlythat they tried to replicate thesituation and got themselves into thesame situation I can't tell thedifference if that's Elmer's glue orGorilla Glue but anywho yeah why are wetrying to make this a trend Gorilla Glueon your hair that's a trend that's whaty'all trying to do I'm seeing too manypranks to me oh I can't get glue out ofmy hair what are y'all doing y'all thatboard that board y'all y'all have kidswatching our pagescan y'all please not make this a trendeverything do not have to be a trendstupidity does not have to be a trendcome on y'all let's do a little bitbetter that Gorilla Glue was not comingout no matter how hard you tried so yeahtessica then went on to explain herjourney of how she tried to get the glueout by going to the hospital but allthey could do was suggest acetone to getit out which she took home to try but ofcourse made no difference and itactually made it all even worse sinceher scalp was now burning and the gluewas stronger than ever and guys at thetime people even went as far as makingonline donations to Jessica so she couldget the help she needed and the donationreached 23 000 people really wanted tohelp this girl out especially since itwas starting to look like she neededmajor medical help but Justice testiclewas starting to lose all hope GinaRodriguez who's a talent managementagent stepped in and called testica totell her all about this plastic surgeonwho was willing to help her for freethey blew me to Californiaand I met with Dr Michael kill bang heused this concoctionon a mannequin with real human hair hestarted working on a solution that wouldbe safe and effective we worked on itthen until we find a perfect solutionthe next day I go over there four hoursI was in surgery and I woke up and theGloom was gone I felt like a kid onChristmas morning thankfully the doctordid an incredible job and it genuinelylooks like it took an insane amount ofeffort I mean just look at these clips[Music]ohhowever the procedure didn't just saveher hair it also inspired her to createher own hair product now that she wasfree to finally grow her hair again thisis when her journey with forever hairstarted the hair product was made of allnatural ingredients and she claims it'swhat got her hair to grow back healthyand fast she said I launched theseproducts to help not only myself butother people like me that need helpgrowing their hair I am so excited aboutthis launch because these products weredoing so well for me and I couldn't waitfor them to help other people I've beenusing it for like two months at thispoint and look at the results look at myhairmy scalp feels amazing my hair isalready growing back I'm telling youthis oil has been a lifesaver so even ifshe had to suffer ridicule andhumiliation online and in real lifeJessica actually managed to turn thewhole thing around and start makingthousands of dollars but y'all even ifthe procedure saved her and she came outon top it also came with some dangerousside effects that testico was notexpecting this is when things gotworrying since the doctor actually foundlumps in her breasts which weresuspected to be cancerous thankfully itturns out her lumps were non-cancerousand it's instead something genetic thatneeds to be looked after just in casecancer does appear unfortunately a sideeffect that wasn't a false alarm was thefact that her hair was extremelysensitive testica actually tried to dyeher hair dark brown in an attempt tocover up some gray hair which turned outto be a massive disaster since her hairimmediately started falling out my hairis steady coming out it falls out andPull-Upsand this was all after she just startedto grow her own hair out after thesurgery so it was a huge disappointmentto her but as it turns out her hairfollicles suffered when the chemicalsused to remove the glue interacted withthe hair dye and it practically meltedthe hair off of her hair this meant thatshe had to go on another trip to LA toget another procedure done that couldsave her scalp and make sure that thiswouldn't happen again the treatmentinvolves stem cell therapy which wasmeant to heal and repair her hairfollicles and it was all injecteddirectly into her scalp it soundsabsolutely terrible but those were theconsequences if tessica ever wanted tohave her hair back tessica also revealedthat she's seen a lot of opportunitiesover the past two years and she was evenon a cooking show she was invited tojoin worse Cooks in America for itsviral sensation theme and she actuallylasted seven whole weeks on the showit's the only thing that I cooked thatpeople can hold down a super Chef Idon't think that's the right color ohit's not looking real linguinewhich you're good at and not only thatbut she even made an entire song abouther experience the track my hair playedon her iconic sentence my hair it don'tmove that everyone had heard she evenposted several tick tocks promoting thesong and she certainly went the rightdirection since the song actually gotmillions of views across all platformsat first a lot of people were put off bythe song thinking it was stupid for herto market off of a dumb mistake but alot of other people were here for it TBHnot mad go get your coins babe let herbe she's enjoying her life y'all knowy'all could have kept scrolling howeverhaters didn't stop tessica from making alot of money off of this the amount ofmoney that I made throughout this wholeordeal it was a lotyeah it was a lot honestly I reallysupport her since she went through somuch and she deserves to see some goodthings come out of it in fact Jessicamade around 400 000 during the past twoyears all from her song Brand dealsmerch hair products and TV appearancesit's safe to say she's livingcomfortably now which can only becelebrated especially because so manypeople were so vile to her some peopleeven made up a rumor that she had diedbecause of the glue and a lot of peoplebelieved it in fact when her song cameout a lot of people were genuinelyconfused since they really believed shehad passed away I thought you were deadwell welcome back I thought she passedaway in fact a lot of people to this daythink tessica was wrong to profit off ofwhat had happened to her because theyfelt like the reasoning behind it wastoo stupid but despite what everyone issaying testica fully admitted to thefact that it was incredibly stupid andeven said that she'd never recreate itagain even if she got a million dollarsfor it everybody knows no matter where Igo somebody's gonna recognize I wouldnever ever put gorilla glue in my hairagain not the pain not the money I don'tcare you can offer me a million dollarsI won't do it however Jessica has seenthe positive in everything especiallybecause she's realized that she actuallyhelped a lot of other people who putthemselves into similarly dumbsituations that have never spoken upabout it now Jessica knows one thing forsure she's over the drama and over thefame and even if she sometimes stillgets recognized as the Gorilla Glue girlwhile being outside she's choosing toshift the focus back onto her own lifeand career but one thing she knows forsure is that she'll never

06/28/2023,What Actually Happened To Gabbie Hanna?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8-fUJQ2TlI,152-13,many many moons ago I made this video exposing Gabby Hannah she's arguably the most controversial internet sensation we ever saw if you remember correctly Gabby Hannah was always in constant whirlwinds of social media scandals like guys she was literally transitioning from one Scandal to another so effortlessly you'd think she was made for this one minute she'd be at it with a fan and then a friend and then another influencer then a stranger then a family member then a best friend and it would go on and on anyways if you've been on these social media streets long enough you already know that it never ends well for such influencers it was only a matter of time before Gabby Hannah was knocked down I guess she could no longer escape the consequences of her actions with many followers and fans questioning her actions if you like me have been wondering what she's been up to lately this babe destroyed her career let's rewind and start for from the very beginning you see before curtains fell on Gabby Hannah she was The Shining Star of the Vine app if you don't know Vine This was The Tick Tock of social media back in 2013 and when it crumbled content creators like Gabby Hannah moved to YouTube on YouTube Gabby Hannah went ahead and built an equally solid and vibrant following through her Channel and she became known for sharing relatable often humorous stories from her own life capturing the attention of millions of viewers her videos often revolve around topics like relationships experiences and challenges presented engagingly and authentically YouTube did work for her her Channel even gained over 5 million subscribers how Gabby Hannah went from being everyone's sweetheart to the most hated influencer is quite crazy if you ask me she got into too many dramas including her ugly Feud with David dobrik and his friends do you remember how things got heated up between her and her old Squad aka the Vlog Squad they used to film Vlogs every single day day until Gabby Hannah moved out of the Vlog Squad house no one knew why she left but some people took it as an opportune moment to insult her for allegedly being at the center of Liza koshy and David dobrik's breakup other fans came to her defense by calling out the squad for harassing her on multiple occasions that's not her makeup that's just her face she ugly the beauty aisle Gabby have you ever been in there probably not he wanted to do a little secret santa since we're all going home for Gabby wait it's something I've needed you've definitely needed it we've all kind of talked about it are these diet pills oh my God but that wasn't even the tip of the iceberg the drama between Gabby Hannah and Trisha Paytas girl the internet was on fire for a hot minute it was years upon years of beef you guys and we could literally make a series for just this so apparently Gabby Hannah summoned enough boldness to walk up to Trisha's boyfriend to warn him that Trisha might be having herpes and that he shouldn't be intimate with her these two dragged each other for years and y'all wouldn't believe how low these 30 year old influencers were willing to go have we slept together did I show you my STD result at are you my doctor did you swab my fish no you'd be forgiven to believe that by this point Gabbie Hannah would think twice about her online altercations and chill right see people always felt the need to bully Gabby for having a big nose while she has addressed this issue several times saying she's comfortable with it some sad people just cannot let it go they've bullied her to the point of making memes September 6 2017 Gabby Hannah decided that her creative juices were too underutilized so she dropped up us a hit yes we all woke up one day and not only was she a YouTuber but Gabby Hannah had also recorded a whole song titled out loud and once again the internet was divided some people felt she's saying pretty okay but others had a field day mocking her voice and there she was trending again for months in all honesty I can see why some people felt she was screaming and not singing on the mountain that's been here all along and since she thrived in controversy she went right ahead and released more and more songs despite her song Monster becoming a viral meme it actually did pretty well and at this point we got to applaud Gabby's resilience because no amount of hate from fans would stop her from dropping more hits well let's just say music was one of her passions for real Gabby couldn't seem to catch a break after being on the receiving end over her music people then shifted to her complexion she was being accused of black fishing multiple times even after explaining that she wasn't all white and that she was from the Middle East mean comments kept coming her way guess who's back guess who's black guess who's trying to be black white people don't even be looking white at this point can we all agree that Gabby Hannah has seven lives can you imagine that after receiving all this backlash when she released a song she still had more content for us she did it again but she didn't release a song this time in September 19th 2017 Gabby Hannah decided to bless us with poetry guys I am talking about Gabby releasing a collection of Illustrated poetry called adult lessons her poetry wasn't too different from her songs the themes revolved around mental health and the complexities of adulthood it goes without saying that she received a generous dose of mockery for this one too anyways I'll just read a few pages and let you be the judge time is relative beauty is relative family is relatives I wear makeup because I have acne I have acne because I wear makeup I donated blood today feels good to finally be somebody's type sad is fine IDK I don't know you know I wonder what dying feels like you too I'll let you know when I find out oh wait decline I lost my credit card and the customer service woman asked me for my credit card number but I don't know my credit card number because I lost my credit card now guys I know at this point y'all are in a dish busy with all this Gabby drama but trust me things are about to take a scaringly overly dramatic turn by this time Gabby Hannah hadn't even Unleashed her deadliest and deepest form of self-sabotage that a content creator can inflict on themselves also guys if you felt some type of way regarding those poems guess who doesn't care Gabby she released another collection in 2020 titled dandelion and am I the only one who felt the low-key cryptic messages behind her poems if you did too just hold that thought we'll get back to it besides YouTube Gabby Hannah also created a strong fan base on Tick Tock with almost 8 million followers and this is where it all went down after years and years of fighting everyone in 2022 Gabby faced the worst of all her battles she went to war with herself she started by sharing messages like this a few days after this post Gabby would disappear from Tick Tock for a few days and then pop up and post several a day in my life videos from that point going on things spiraled well you see Gabby's Tick Tock content was always about fun dancing music and mental health and in just three days Gabby Hannah's reputation took a severe hit as she uploaded over 170 videos and displayed concerning Behavior At first she did several videos talking about God how she can change the world and children you know every time I say I'm Gonna Save the World people laugh at me root for us I'm fighting for we our cross to bear don't you want to see she went on and on talking about the need to save the homeless babies wake the [ __ ] up before we go to sleep wake the [ __ ] up there's Babies on the street Gabby Hannah then got so engrossed in what seemed to be a manic episode that she scared her fans online at some point she started asking very strange questions like what if I was the mother of God what if I was the mother of God what if I got to bring the good news of the second comings she kept posting these disturbing videos every single minute sometimes even crying we could be the person who saved the world instead of laughing why don't you pray with me why don't you encourage me at some point Gabby Hannah shocked fans when she started yelling hysterically asking people to help her help me help me wake the up help me help Gabby Hannah went on and on talking about anything and everything and she did a record of over 160 videos within the next two days she even claimed to have died gone to heaven and returned the next minute she was explaining the origin of her name she said she was named after the biblical Angel Gabriel I am Gabrielle Angel Gabriel I am Hannah Arabic translation John three Three Brothers of four took the name Gabriel when fans kept suggesting that she really needed to talk to someone she introduced her housekeeper to us in one of her videos she introduced her housekeeper Delilah who seemed to be used to Gabby being unstable one minute Gabby was praising her for saving her life and the next second she was yelling her guys at some point Gabby went live on Tick Tock and she had a lot to say about single parenting she talked about fathers leaving women to take care of their kids alone and even this conversation ended religiously she said these women made it through because they depended on God and she had a message for people who were calling her manic so people who actually don't give a about anyone about themselves regardless of how hard they've been lying to themselves for a very long time are so concerned for me because I'm manic right considering that she had admitted in previous videos that she had bipolar fans online were certain that she was having a meltdown and someone needed to be there to get her meds the big question is was help on the way guys you haven't heard the plot twist yet Gabby kept updating her fans online and at one point she mentioned letting a total stranger inside like this is someone who might not be thinking straight and when most people thought she was lying she uploaded several videos of the said visitor introducing him as Nicholas guys can you let a stranger into your home just because they need to use the bathroom urgently personally I would never but that's just me gabby Hannah is cool with it they actually seemed to get along very well Gabby Hannah and Nicholas were even planning to go for a run Gabby later changed her mind and threw him out and up till now no one knows Nicholas's actual intentions but he got a few seconds of Fame because shortly after leaving Gabby Hannah's house he started going live on Tick Tock answering people's questions regarding her status most people disapproved of this also considering that it was a man but Gabby said that once she had posted his face online there was no way this stranger would harm her I'd say Gabby was being too erratic at this point and this wasn't the only stranger she welcomed in she later mentioned letting another girl in because she seemed hurt Gabby said she felt the need to help her because the bruised lady looked like the ghost of a dead person who is struggling to cross over to the other world then there was another man who pulled up at her place with two dogs and he said he had seen the situation online and chose to help guys remember these are people Gabby Hannah had never seen before according to her of all three strangers she felt safest around the guy with the dogs she said it was quite unfortunate that he didn't manage to get inside Gabby Hannah then announced that someone had broken into her house asking fans to pray for her then she went offline for a couple of hours and turns out her neighbors heard her screams and called the police they evaluated her and found her fit to just be at home when she came back to her senses Gabby Hannah confirmed what many had feared she had suffered a Mania attack she did pull down most of the video she had posted and had a lot of explanations to do and apologies to make remember when I told you I felt some type of way concerning her poetry it finally made sense even her songs lyrics made so much sense after her almost 72-hour meltdown could it be that Gabby Hannah talked so much about mental health because she was dealing with it was it her coping mechanism and all these online wars were they a cry for help you see during her Prime in Social media Gabby Hannah literally had the gasoline and the match in her own hands but she still blamed everybody else for lighting the fire after this last major mental breakdown it looks like she is taking a break there have been zero engagements across all of her online platforms she hasn't posted anything on YouTube for 10 months her last tweet was in January 2023 and that's the same situation on her Instagram and Tick Tock as well guys do you remember the days where Gabby Hannah ran the streets please let me know in the comment section 
05/27/2023,That Vegan Teacher is a HYPOCRITE (eating meat for views),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1qhB_SzT4w,146-11,that vegan teacher is back to being hypocritical on the Internet only this time you guys she's actually losing her mind to the point where she's now eating meat for views didn't know clout chasing had this much power on a person it's been a while since we've addressed that vegan teacher on my channel despite how she's been active on social media throughout 2023. it came as a shock to me that Miss Katie is still using her followers for views and the people who are watching are still following for her nonsense each time so without further Ado guys let's address the motive behind Miss Katie's spreading veganism and how it all turned out to be fake and misleading if you guys know that vegan teacher aka Miss Katie then you probably know how awful of a person she is this woman went from advocating to people about being vegan to straight up harassing strangers online for eating meat and at one point Miss Katie started making horrible comments about people who weren't vegan including her family members who she claimed she would never donate her organs to or to any person who wasn't vegan if somebody in my family is dying and needs my kidney or needs my bone marrow they can't have it not unless they're vegan this situation made millions of people uncomfortable and upset not because of how Miss Katie wouldn't donate her organs to a non-vegan person but because of the way she came after her family members on the internet for no reason other than this Miss Katie has also made multiple racial comments about POC people which honestly boosted Miss Katie's career because her name was popping off everywhere on social media back then with millions of people attacking her for being racist can you think of some words right now that our banned is Banning words a good idea when does it end is it a good idea really it should have been clear from the start that Miss Katie is a genius at manipulating people and making them look stupid by attacking her because one thing that you guys should know is that Miss Kitty has been on the internet for years now and she is a master at gaining clout whenever her hype dies down I mean have we forgotten about the time when PewDiePie was making tons of videos about Miss Katie just because of a stupid video she made about him or when she literally came after Gordon Ramsay sniperwolf and the popular twitch streamer Tommy in it and guess what she was able to make all of them respond to her which boosted her entire career to the highest level now you might be asking is that vegan teachers still thriving on social media despite the cancellation that she's been through well I can't necessarily answer your question because if we go on Tick Tock Miss Kitty has multiple Tick Tock pages with over a hundred followers and if you watch her videos you can see that she's still spreading veganism to her followers and making songs about it every day however when when you click on her YouTube channel this woman is barely getting any views now I mean she went from making millions of views from dragging other influencers including me to barely cracking 10K views on her Channel and at one point you would think that Miss Katie would take it to another level by making nasty comments just to gain views and as much as I hate to say this that's exactly what she did last month instead of Miss Katie's spreading veganism and talking about the struggles animals face every day she decided to make a full video about cats titled should cats exist if not vegan they should either be veganized or euthanized just from the title alone you can tell that this video will be full of nonsense information because Miss Katie started off her video talking about how people were gonna be upset about what she had to say check this out most of you won't like what I'm about to talk about you'll think that it's a bit crazy you'll probably be angry also her being aware that people might be upset with her opinion should have been cleared to y'all that she's using her followers for attention because she began talking about how people who have cats are allowing other people to kill animals so their cats could eat them every time you buy cat food you're paying somebody to murder other innocent animals who also had a right to live this has got to be a joke to make this even worse you guys Miss Katie also began sharing how toxic it is that animals have to be slaughtered in order for cats to survive and how the animals in cat food have the right to live just as the cats that we keep in our homes the fish on this package had a right to live his or her life was as valuable as the life of a cat but it contains the body of an innocent animal Miss Katie ended her video by convincing people to make cats vegan otherwise they should be put down just like the meat industry does to other animals if your cats are not vegan you're paying for animal abuse and that's wrong I know she's lying I'm confused about how she's giving a solution to animals being killed for food by killing other animals like does this even make sense to y'all honestly from her video it seems that Miss Kitty has zero clue about what kind of message she was trying to spread to her followers because her opinion was very hypocritical consider during the fact that she's a huge animal rights activist now let's talk about her Tick Tock video about cats that went viral because someone decided to ask Miss Maddie whether she has seen a video of a guy putting a cat in the blender and y'all her response was extremely insane after she claimed that people only feel pity when cats are being unalived instead of other animals just like cows and chickens check this out a cut is a chicken is a dog is a cow it's all the same it is horrific what goes on this Tick Tock video somehow gained over 5 million views as tons of people agreed with Miss Katie and the message that she was trying to put out to her followers because she even responded to a comment of someone sympathizing with a cat by saying this me personals I was crying were you crying because you thought about the dead animals inside of you be morally consistent be vegan right now it's actually insane how people are suddenly agreeing with that vegan teacher as if they weren't attacking her for spreading veganism peacefully years ago but for some reason this level support didn't quite satisfy Miss Katie at all after she decided to go from being an animal rights activist to straight up convincing people to eat meat I wish I was joking you guys this started when a tick tock account that allegedly belonged to Miss Katie suddenly turned into a meat account after her username changed to real that meat t-shirt and even her bio says hashtag eat for life as well a lot of people were confused once this happened however none of them were prepared for what was about to come because Miss Katie started posting videos of herself supporting people cooking and slaughtering animals with the hashtag meet for Life check this out perfect pool baby shake oh my God [Music] who were shocked to see this because these two Tick Tock videos gained over 20 million views alone with thousands of people commenting about how they've missed a few chapters and what could have made that vegan teacher eat meat all of a sudden I mean keep in mind Miss Katie's vegan account on Tick Tock was still active while this was happening as she was posting content regularly about veganism however at the same time she was also making videos about how she supports animals being slaughtered and how she wants to eat meat so badly at first people thought this was reverse psychology because millions of people were commenting on her videos each day being confused as heck about how Miss Katie was going from supporting animals to straight up eating them until this video of Miss Katie eating a burger that was supposedly made of real cow went viral people immediately knew something sketchy was going on in this video because apparently this video was filmed a long time ago when Miss Katie was trying a vegan burger although if we watch this video we can see that the person who typed these texts on the screen made it seem that Miss Kitty was eating real meat instead of vegan meat this started a huge speculation on social media about whether this account was fake or not and whether Miss Kitty had any knowledge of it because it's unbelievable how this account has over 600k followers which is way more than what Miss Katie has it wouldn't be shocking if Miss Katie was actually controlling that account because she has the tendency of making controversial decisions just to keep her name in the spotlight and there are tons of rumors that her meet account used to belong to her years ago before it got deactivated anyways here's what people had to say about Miss Katie that vegan teacher more like that vegan clout Chaser wait you guys still haven't realized she's ironic she's a troll you guys need to stop giving her attention I personally think what she's doing is really elaborate bait slash internet personality thing for attention because how could someone act like this it's not even funny I would love to hear your opinions on the situation down below but for now make sure to click on the tab above for more videos on these influencers 
03/23/2023,Mom Influencer In Huge Trouble (Son taken Away),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMUvNoPDA0,128-14,I've talked to you guys a lot about family channels over the years and how harmful it can be to share Children online between parents embarrassing their children pranking children there's been so much out there that should not be the exploitive nature of these videos have been a big topic as more and more channels have popped up over the years and it isn't just on one single platform parents posting their children and making them the stars of their content stems across all platforms but this that we're talking about today is quite a sad story and goes to show you that sharing Children online comes with a lot and the internet is a powerful place and all parents need to be careful about what they're putting out there and how it can come across honestly I think this story goes for people that have literally one follower to millions of followers this could truly happen to anyone if your video goes viral of your kid you should be careful with what you're posting a tick tock mom recently found out just how powerful the internet really is after she shared a video of her husband and her son and in the video I'm not gonna show it but her husband basically robbed their child in Saran wrap from like his neck to his knees he was falling over I don't know why they thought this was some light-hearted funny video because it wasn't it was just weird and not something that should be put online it was embarrassing and sad just hard to watch overall and the video went viral and as a result people who viewed The Tick Tock reported the parents to child protective services and The Tick Tock ended up getting deleted but that didn't cause the issue to go away as CPS took these claims of concern seriously and actually remove their son from their home the mom ended up posting a video about it on Tick Tock the next day explaining her side of the situation no we're dealing with a situation where Gunner has been taken from us until cprs can evaluate our home because I posted a video of my husband and son playing video was strewn away as two people thinking that we were abusing our child one Gunner was like laughing and smiling and it was just a funny thing that Hank did um because Gunner was getting into like the stove that day and like tried putting a fork in his socket and um like Hank like playfully wrapped them and clean rap He had room to move like he looked like a little worm Like A Little Cucumber it was at no point in distress or crying or anything like that like we would never hurt ours our son like we would never hurt our our child she begins to explain that at first she was getting positive comments so she thought nothing of it and then later on cop showed up at her door over this video they questioned her and her husband and she thought that her son was going to be returned to her after this and CPS could evaluate their house but that wasn't actually the case we went down and like made her statements and thinking that like Gunner was gonna like be returned to us that day um and that like CPS would do their investigation and see that our home is safe um and now we met our child no harm I don't know what to do um whether to stay quiet or post a video or like private my my uh social media because of the amount of hate that I'm getting I don't know what the right thing is to do or to say all I all I can say is that my son so loved and cherished my miracle baby like he's my was my fourth pregnancy after three miscarriages and he's the light of my life she begins to explain that people are interpreting the video wrong she isn't like a Family Channel or anything like that she's just an influencer who happens to be a mom and she says that even though she has like a million followers her Tick Tock is not monetized she's not making money off of her kid or anything like that some people are are taking this contact s and like not even knowing hankara I make zero money off of my off my social media my Tick Tock is not monetized like at all any money off of my kid I just post little Vlogs sometimes and like little pieces of like our life together and um feel really helpless in this situation I feel so dumb reposting for boosting that and like thinking it was just like a cute Family Video and then it turning into this I know that people are gonna are gonna hate me or like just like have opinions on this and like I unders I absolutely understand that I just want people to know that like I I love that little boy more than anything in the whole world and I would never hurt him never ever some disagreed with her description of the video that she had posted feeling like it wasn't a light-hearted video like she said it was but they did feel for her and hoped that this will cause her to change what she chooses to share of her son online the next day their son was returned to them and she shared a video on Tick Tock saying home where he belongs CPS cleared us of wrongdoings and determined our home with us is a safe one for our son despite that a hard lesson was learned a mistake we will never make again this weekend was extremely traumatic for us as a family and will be taking time away to heal I feel like this was a major lesson to not just her but a lot of people that way you share online does get seen by the public in their serious consequences that can come with sharing your children online now there are a lot of people feeling like this was very extreme for them to take away her child it is extremely traumatic that is for sure sure and it is such a sad story and I will say that throughout the years of seeing family channels and people just share their kids online there are comments that you see about people being like we're a CPS or like why hasn't anyone reported them to CPS and family channels have complained about getting calls from CPS but I haven't ever really seen it happen when they do remove the child from the home I think it's only happened like one other time that I know of with a family channel so to hear about this I was like shook you guys I was like this is really really crazy and it's just sad something that you don't want to see happen and I do think as the years go on people will start to see more and more why sharing Children online just isn't the best idea preserving their online identity until they can understand it for themselves seems to be the best whether you're famous or not people find it embarrassing enough when parents bring out the baby books but imagine the whole freaking baby book is online like on Facebook on Instagram Tick Tock YouTube it's overwhelming nobody wants to see your kids first bath except for creeps like keep that stuff to yourself it's truly it's better it's better for everyone and your kids will thank you and The Internet's been around long enough for kids who have grown up online to now speak out about their experiences growing up on the internet in hopes that other parents will listen to them and protect their own kids from the same feelings that they are experiencing an article was recently published in Teen Vogue titled influence her parents and the kids who had their childhood made into content this article details Claire a girl whose parents currently run a Family Channel her name had been changed for the article to protect her identity because she's still living at home with her parents but wants to speak out as soon as she can live on her own with like her real name and everything but until then she wants to keep Anonymous but she did share kind of what she's going through as this teenager living with her parents who have this channel the article says search clear his name online and this is some of what you'll find photos of her as a child merchandise with her face on it available for sale and a YouTube channel with millions of subscribers and hundreds of videos featuring Claire and members of her family in the videos Claire grows from a toddler to a teenager on Instagram fans comment they miss videos from the old days in public people sometimes recognize her and ask for photos altogether the family's YouTube channel has over a billion views but if it were up to Claire none of the videos would exist the first time she went viral she was a toddler when the family's Channel started to rake in views clear says both her parents left their jobs because the revenue from the YouTube channel was enough to support the family and to land them a nicer house and new car that's not fair that I have to support everyone she said I try not to be resentful but I kind of am when she told her dad she didn't want to do YouTube videos anymore and he told her they would have to move out of their house and her parents would have to go back to work leaving no money for nice day things when the families together the YouTube channel is what they talk about Claire says her father has told her he may be her father but he's also her boss it's a lot of pressure she says when Claire turns 18 and can move out of her house she's considering going no contact with her parents when she doesn't live with them anymore she plans to speak out publicly about being the star of a YouTube channel she'll even use her real name Claire wants people to know how her childhood was overshadowed by social media stardom that she didn't choose and she wants her parents to know nothing they do now is going to take back the years of work I had to put in she also claimed that she didn't even know how much money her parents had actually set aside for her to use in the future they had claimed that they saved money for her college but she isn't sure how much of that is versus what she actually made for them all these years it truly is just so sad to hear that this is the reality for Claire but also the reality for so many other children online whose parents make them the source of income and not even that because there are so many people who try to get to the this level by posting things on tick tock on Instagram on Facebook on YouTube of their kids and they never make it to this level where they have millions of subscribers but the fact that they like try to get to this level by posting stuff of their kids that's like so sad to me as well the people that like seek out this life now I do think that there's different levels to the way people share their kids online obviously there are family channels where the children are like the main characters of their videos and everything but then there's influencers who just so happen to have kids and they've logged their life and I don't think that that is that bad but I do think that this story as a whole these two that we talked about today it just goes to show you that you should just really be mindful of what you are sharing of your kids online so maybe think twice before sharing something but as of right now the situation remains as it is pretty much like unmonitored except by the public and now we've seen like how extreme it kind of can get when the public does get involved I just found this to be such a crazy story and just so sad at the same time but I certainly want to know if you guys have heard about this and or what you guys think about this whole situation including this Teen Vogue article let me know your thoughts in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music] no no no no no no no 
03/16/2023,This TikToker Keeps Getting Cancelled (Tara's World),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0YHDuMV_oU,129-13,take talker Tara has been getting in a ton of trouble lately a lot of my for you page has been people stitching her videos and talking about what's wrong with what she just said she's had a couple viral moments and they haven't really gone viral for a good reason that's for sure some I think are funny like how she unknowingly spent thirty thousand dollars on Harry Styles tickets I spent thirty thousand five hundred ninety nine dollars on how are you concerts I'm a gum I'm gonna go like work and pretend like I didn't pay Harry's electric bill for like the next 10 years how does that even happen like not a reason to hate her but tons of people were coming for her I mean it's her money probably not the smartest move but who are we to judge I guess she's making a bag she's spending a bag on Harry Styles um but I mean that was shocking definitely not hate worthy but I was shook when she said thirty thousand dollars but other things that she said have actually gotten her in real trouble and a little bit more deserving of a conversation Tara recently moved apartments and she's been filming a ton of tick tocks showing outside of her window talking about what's walking distance to her apartment and she's even talked about the amenities that her apartment building offers and people warned her that this was pretty dangerous and that there are scary people out there that will remember this stuff and she should really be careful with what she shares online and people were also under the impression that she had to move out of her previous Apartments because of strangers finding her address offended more than anything she actually responded to people saying that she was safe and people need to mind their own business and they have no lives just talking about her and hating on her for no reason everybody on here seems to think that I move every month because people are finding out where I live and stalking me no and even if people found out where I lived it really wouldn't matter I live in like an extremely high security building so like who cares I'm also not Kardashian oh my God she moves like every month I moved once a year and it was all for like good reasons y'all got nothing better to Doom she moves like every month because she always gives away the location of her apartment because she's dumb in an airhead get a life right get a life I'm so I'm like so tired of that and in the comments people were not pleased by this saying bro you need a reality check regardless of the security of your building please be careful I think people are just genuinely concerned love there are crazy people out there this is giving I'm untouchable I can never be in danger I think people are worried about you I think it comes from a good place you're mad fans care this tone is giving mean girl energy now I will say that I do think people were confusing her for another tick tocker Tabitha because they were both moving around the same time and Tabitha actually did say that she was moving because people found her address and were coming to her door and made a whole Tick Tock about it so as you guys know I'm finally moving because someone leaked my address and if you were wondering it's currently 9pm and this is what I'm dealing with I'm moving tomorrow I can't wait so I'm pretty sure people were just confusing them and Tara actually just moved because she wanted to move but I mean people were concerned they feel like they didn't really deserve to be attacked for being concerned about her get a uh life no Tara you don't get to be mad people would kill to have that many people online concerned about their well-being total strangers okay you are chronically online weekly talking about you're being paranoid that somebody's following you or in your apartment or whatever so you don't get to be mad that people are a little concerned when you're showing people a complete map to what you're doing in your new neighborhood with addresses and everything in the background and there's a lot of young impressionable women on the internet that follow you and might think of you as an example and they need to know that it's not okay to post all of those little details in the background because those little details could be a fine line between life and death for some people you need to like listen to a true crime podcast or watch like a Netflix documentary because I just don't think you're getting it but you don't seem to want anybody to care so godspeed after this whole drama another one of Tara's posts started going viral because she was doing a get ready with me talking about how she's straight but she enjoys kissing girls and talks about how her boyfriend likes it and how guys like seeing that and also talked about how her ex never liked her doing that she didn't understand why she found it weird that he didn't like her kissing other girls everyone is like tweaking out because I hooked up with a girl for work when I have a boyfriend no we are not in an open relationship but he was more than okay with it he literally came over and like hung out with us when we were done also like I'm straight like I've always wanted to like hook up with a girl and like I kiss girls all the time but I don't think I could ever like date a girl I've only ever been like emotionally into like men but I just think girls are hot like that's the thing and it's so fun to like kiss girls you know what I mean I think it was like the third or fourth time me and my now boyfriend were hanging out he brought me to this like event and I saw this girl there that I knew and like we kissed I kissed all of my girlfriends like all the time it's just what we do and he was so excited like his eyes lit up he was like you can do that whenever you want it was the funniest thing ever like he was so excited I remember my last boyfriend well we're never like officially dated but like we basically were he was so insecure about that kind of thing I remember I asked him once I was like how would you feel if I like kissed a girl because most guys like love that he got so mad at me like yelling at me being like I can't believe you want to kiss somebody I was like no not in that way like I just figured I'd ask like he was kind of crazy and like to each their own it was just funny I was like you're lying to me right now like most guys like love that he did not um but yeah I would never like hook up with a guy for my of like even if I didn't have a boyfriend I just wouldn't do that especially if I have a boyfriend I would if like I was like dating the person but I don't think I would just like hook up with some dude but girls are different because they are magical and perfect in time of people replied to this story saying obviously he wouldn't enjoy watching you cheat and also felt like she was baptizing women being together to please men if you and your boyfriend have no problem with you making out with women but if you did it with a man it would be a different story then it kind of shows that you don't think that women loving women intimacy is valid or real except for the pleasure that it gives to the male gays and this is just such an icky Tick Tock oh my God what needs to be said has already been said I mean this video is actually incredible it was it's almost like it's scripted it's like what not to say after what not to say after what not to say after what not to say but I think the cherry on top of this the one of the more subtle spits in the face is that you made me agree with this straight man when he was you know talking about what it means to be a queer woman oh my god dude oh my God hey Bae so how would you feel if I cheated on you I would not like that what the it turned into a whole thing and she responded on Tick Tock with this on this week's episode of what am I getting canceled for I am homophobic and fantasizing lesbians because I like to kiss girls welcome to my world this is better than cable I'll tell you that much who needs obx3 when you have my comment section you know what I mean I have a couple of things that will really piss you guys off hold on I love kissing girls like suck cry about it and honestly if you if your entire life mission is to sit on your couch and scrutinize my every move if we're being real it's kind of entertaining so you can keep going but man do I feel bad for you and just recently she went on a Brianna chicken fries podcast and talked more about all the hate that she's been getting recently I was out at dinner like a week ago like getting drunk with my boyfriend we were like I was so wine drunk and Lila called me you guys know Lila yeah right yeah so she called me and she was like I wanna like hook up for only fans I was like no what'd she say she was just like oh like let's just like make out and like pillow fight yeah I have like a naked pillow fight for only fans I was like no like I want to like be in the past sorry let's go I was so drunk I was like yeah duh like I want to do that so bad um so we like made a plan to do it and then I made like a get ready with me to like to like do it and I was just saying like oh yeah like I love kissing girls like it's so fun like I've always wanted to like hook up with a girl but like I've only ever dated guys like I'm pretty sure I'm like straight in that way I just like think girls are hot I like to kiss girls like when I'm out drinking like I always kiss girls or whatever and like people took that as like I lesbians and like just like like that like I'm like I've internalized homophobia like all these crazy narratives came out of that and I was just like okay like I didn't even know how to respond to it you know have you responded to it at all no I made like there was a few comments talking about like oh like how like she's cheating on her boyfriend but he didn't care so I made like a video about that and I was just like guys he like doesn't care like he was literally there like he doesn't mind she's like blah blah blah but that's the only thing that I've like I don't really don't like apologize unless it like I actually do something up and like then I'll obviously apologize for it but if I don't feel like I have to apologize I won't like I'm not gonna like fake an apology yeah a lot of like influencers I know will like make a whole like sappy apology video but they don't mean it like most of the time like I'm not gonna do that yeah I'll normally just be like yeah you guys like whatever I mean she seems pretty unbothered by all the hate she's seen this way the last time that she was called out and I had talked about the time where she was first really really receiving a lot of hate and it was for calling her friends lazy she had posted a tick tock talking about how her friends post on be real which is like an app that a timer goes off like once a day and you're supposed to take a picture of what you're doing it takes a selfie and like a picture of what you're looking at and she says like all her friends were in bed and I mean and people just didn't love what she said does anybody have a job does anyone work I swear to God just be real like I I like get on myself all the time even though I'm the most productive person ever like I'm always doing something I'm never in bed in the middle of the day and then I got be real and this b-roll could go off at 11AM 1pm three it doesn't matter everyone's in bed there's an alarming amount of people every time that be real goes off that are just in bed with the with the shades drawn and it makes me feel so good about myself I'm like why are you in bed seems like nobody wants to work these days apps up and work she was called Al people said how dare she even have the audacity to say people are lazy in bed they're probably just tired because working is hard and she's just a privileged influencer she shouldn't be talking about other people this way and it turned into this whole thing and the worst part was instead of just coming out and like clarifying what she meant or saying sorry she added some more fuel to the fire and said my job isn't easy you guys see LMAO too soon and it's a video of her doing like a tick tock dance she tried to then make videos clarifying that she was only talking about her influencer friends laying around in bed all day and she said that she wasn't talking about random people when she posted that and couldn't believe how big this whole thing had gotten I mean the whole thing really was wild and obviously they hadn't really chilled out since with all this new drama every other week I feel like she's getting called out for something that she's posted on Tick Tock or something that she said but I mean she's just going about her life on father colored and honestly it kind of gives me 10 of Vibes a little bit I'm like this is giving Tana from a few years ago where there's a new thing every single week and she just doesn't really care but either way this whole thing is certainly interesting what's gone on and I want to know what you guys think about all of this so let me know your thoughts in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys 
03/04/2023,The Kelly Family is in Big Trouble,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOxB6DKCtKg,107-15,meet the Kelly Family a tick tock family that has over 1 million followers on Tick Tock and has been the center of drama for weeks now parents Ty and Haley found themselves getting called out after a post on Tick Tock where they decide that their son loves to ride thrill rides at theme parks but he just isn't tall enough to ride them all so they decided to make him platform shoes and have him wear them at the park to make sure that he meets the height requirement they were calling this a little parenting hack meet my son Cannon our thrill-seeking boy who can't get enough of Disney theme park rides the only problem you ask he's just not tall enough for the big ones but we didn't want that to stop him from feeling the rush so we took matters into our own hands and crafted a shoe that just might do the trick and when people saw this they were horrified and just calling them out saying how unsafe this is in that there's obviously height requirements in place on rides for a reason upset over the backlash Tai stood his ground and he responded to the comments and people felt gaslit by his words because he claimed the video was not supposed to be taken seriously and it was all jokes and jokes on us because his son is actually tall enough to ride these rides that they went on without the shoes I would never ever ever put my kids in actual danger that's number one number two I would never condone any other parent trying to put their kid on a ride that they're not tall enough or something that's not safe for them that's number two number three you don't actually know what happened in the video you didn't see him going on any rides all you saw was him wearing a platform shoe that made him way over the height of 38 inches you want to know why because he's already tall enough with regular shoes to be 38 inches tall so before you start throwing stones get the facts straight oh and by the way the two thrill rides he rode was Slinky Dog Dash and Smugglers Run he had a really really good chance of falling out of those rides I tell you what people didn't react well to this and said how dare you be misled by my own words parent influencers are so red flag I can't believe you guys had the audacity to assume that what I said in the video was what I meant he's already tall enough created shoes to make him tall I would never put my kid in danger except apparently for Disney ride please did he really just Gaslight us all despite the hate on Tick Tock the Kelly family decided to post this video onto YouTube as well and you can literally see in the YouTube video they're making the shoes they're putting the shoes on their son at the theme park the video was literally titled I made my toddler tall enough for thrill rides at Disney like how am I supposed to know that he wasn't already tall enough that's your title like come on now but unlike what they did on Tick Tock they actually put a little tiny baby disclaimer in the description of this video that said disclaimer this video is not in to be taken seriously as we made this video solely for entertainment purposes do not attempt this yourself Disney is great at their jobs and you will get caught but people were obviously calling him out they were calling him and his wife out at that but especially him because he's the one that was responding on Tick Tock and responding to all the haters people had so much to say they were tagging Disney trying to get them banned from the parks forever for doing this and he was holding his ground except unlike his defense on Tick Tock where he said my son was tall enough he actually went in the Commons and was like my son had a great day that's all that matters someone commented great parenting teaching kids rules don't have to apply to them and aren't implemented for safety and they said my kids just going to remember having the time of his life at Disney someone all said pretty sure those shoes aren't going to hold him in the seat in the event of an unfortunate incident this is like thinking platform shoes and weight belts can make your kids safe in the car without a car seat that is not how it works they reply arcade is nearly 40 pounds he's plenty heavy enough for Slinky Dog Dash and this made me laugh because you'd think that with this response the Slinky Dog Dash would be like the teacups or something when it's actually this ride like I feel like you would have to be the height requirement to ride this roller coaster I don't care if it's a little baby roller coaster to everybody else in your eyes I just see like why risk it why would you risk it you know like in a year or two like he'll be tall enough you know but anyways someone else decided to call them out for not taking accountability for having done this and encouraged others to do the same saying why is it so hard for you guys to admit you made a wrong decision and apologized instead y'all hear trying hards to justify it I guess it's true money is a lot more important for y'all and they replied no money involved just know what we did wasn't a big deal like y'all are making it out to be so clearly he's saying that is not a big deal like he does not think that this is a big deal what their video is so Tai ended up making another apology video on Tick Tock and instead of gaslighting people he actually did say that he was sorry about all of this hey everyone so it's been a crazy last few days and we've been getting a lot of negative publicity over the last few days and over the over a few of the videos that we posted and honestly I just wanted to address all of you I just wanted every single one of you to hear me say that I'm a very much flawed individual I have lots of problems many of you have pointed those out if we were making so much money off of social media then I wouldn't have to work a full-time job and my wife wouldn't have to work her job so we're not making a lot of money not much at all off of social media I would have already removed that video if I thought it was wrong the one thing that I do want to apologize for is all the people that actually stood up for us and tried to you know protect us or vouch for us and then you got attacked because of us I want to apologize for that and I'm really really sorry that that happened to you and I could have handled certain parts of this situation better and I'll be the first one to say that so um I'm sorry that I didn't handle this the perfect way however I'm not going to take the video down no they did end up removing all the videos though and seemingly understanding what the issue was and him and his wife did sit down to film a video for Youtube and Tick Tock apologizing together hey everyone so we'd like to address this Disney shoe situation one more time so what started off as us trying to make an entertaining video for our audience that we thought you'd enjoy quickly turned into US realizing that what we put out on our platforms has more consequences than we initially thought we have more influence than we initially thought and that influence if presented in a negative way could have a ripple effect that could potentially cause harm or danger to someone else Although our son was unharmed and completely okay we do now understand that that may not be the case for some other kid and the last thing that we'd want to happen from something that we put out on our social media is for someone to get hurt in light of this realization we've decided to take all the videos down related to this content we hope that you'll give us the opportunity to prove that we love our children we love you all we love each other and that with influence comes responsibility and we take that seriously but after this things kinda get weird because the drama didn't stop there Tai actually went on live almost every single day since this whole situation started to respond to haters I don't mind blocking you I don't mind blocking you at all because what wouldn't you do for your Tick Tock Fame what kind of question is that my first mistake was making kids okay I disagree with you 100 percent like intensely reading the chat and talking to people about this still been watching this and people are literally crazy it just scares me for you uh look it's all right it's all right God's gonna take care of us um God knows our heart and he knows what's up and all these people that are making judgments they can they can make judgments and we tried to own up for the part that we felt like we did wrong and that's why we uh you know took down stuff and um the other stuff is it's gonna be okay gonna be all right it kind of reminded me of the video where Gabby Hannah was on live like typing just like so invested in the comments and the original video was posted weeks ago you guys but literally a couple days ago I was scrolling on Tick Tock and there's Ty and someone had said that they were actually a wife of an employee that works at a theme park and she accepts his apology and boy did he run with us I appreciate the apology as the wife of a cast member at Hollywood Studios Savannah hey Savannah I just want to say something hey Savannah um question you don't have to you really really don't have to but um I would love to chat with you for a second um I don't know if you can uh request to to be a guest on here but I'd love to just chat with you just for a moment hey he wanted her to come and join the live and I believe he really wanted her to join to be like look someone who knows somebody that works at Disneyland doesn't think I'm a horrible person and I think he really wanted to show the haters like look like I'm not I'm not bad I'm not bad but this it really didn't end up being how he wanted it to go that is for sure so she joined the live and she talked about how hard it is to be a cast member and she really wanted to tell him that along with his apology if he really wanted to use his platform for good he should advocate for cast member raises and you could tell he was like yeah that's not what I wanted you to say but good for her like she got on that live and she was advocating for her husband who works at the park and she was advocating for raises because truly minimum wage does not cut it for what they're dealing with every single day at those parks and I know a lot of people that have worked at both Disney and Universal that did not get paid enough for how chipper they need to be at work that is for sure but despite this little interaction that he had that did not really go his way and he didn't really get that like Fu to the haters that I think he really wanted he's still been going live so it doesn't seem like he's ready to let the conversation about all of this go and I don't really think that that's like healthy like to be arguing with the haters like in the comments on live like every single day but as of right now that's what's been said by them and what people have had to say in reaction to their post I had no idea who this family was before all of this but once I heard what was going on and I saw their response I was like was I just Gaslight by a Family Channel like I I really wanted to talk about with you guys because I just could not believe what was going on but let me know your thoughts and if you guys have seen this family on Tick Tock or if you guys have heard about the situation let me know in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music] foreign 
01/09/2023,Danielle Cohn BULLIED For Going Back to her Ex Ethan Fair..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAGG6-XDr1Q,88-10,the entire internet is going after Danielle Cohen for not only rekindling her friendship with her ex Ethan fair but also for defending him after he did her dirty this is going to be very aside from Daniel Cohen receiving tons of hate this week well Bryce Hall also decided to join Danielle and embarrass himself in front of the entire internet after he got into a fight with multiple security guards in Vegas and y'all even Mala trevejo got exposed by her ex-staffers for being racist and abusive and they're now seeking over 4 million dollars in Damages as you can see a lot has gone down in the last couple of days so with that being said let's just go ahead straight to our first drama from where do I even start you guys I was literally talking about Danielle's stupid drama with her ex Mason a couple of weeks ago and now she's in big trouble over her ex Ethan fair if you guys didn't already know Danielle broke up with her recent ex Mason a couple of months ago after she announced it on her Instagram story this situation escalated quickly after the pair got into an argument online to which an unknown girl stepped in and revealed that Mason did in fact cheat on Danielle with her of course Mason kept denying this accusation while trying to gain Danielle's trust again but from Danielle's responses she seems that she was completely over him as if she had moved on already from the situation a couple of weeks later Mason tried getting Danielle's attention Again by posting about her constantly and pretending that they had never broken up but unfortunately the man got bored to the point where he switched on Danielle out of the blue and liked a very shady comment towards her after he posted a video with a new girl not him pretending that he wasn't crying and throwing up over Danny anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this cute little update because we're about to get into some serious stuff right now if you guys didn't know one of Danielle's exes that had a huge impact on Danny's life aside from mikitua was Ethan Fair Ethan fair was a normal tick tocker who had a couple thousand followers on social media before he blew up and he somehow managed to pull Danielle after they began teasing each other on the internet months later the couple announced their relationship and started creating content with each other for their fans but for some reason the couple didn't last too long after they broke up four months into their relationship for for unknown reasons so yes me and Danny did break up but I just wanted to say that it's all good vibes she was an amazing girlfriend I really did love her and I really do wish the best for her and everyone else this started a huge speculation in The Tick Tock Community about their relationship and whether Ethan fair was using Danielle for clout this entire time or not that was until Danielle cleared up the rumors months later where she revealed in a YouTube video that she had an abortion after an audio conversation got leaked to the public and while she opened up in the video about the struggles she faced and how it came as a complete shock when she found out other than that she also revealed that she had to go through it without any support at all after her boyfriend left her alone during the pregnancy first third thought in my head was let me call the person who I was with that night and tell him and and let's just say I went through it alone and that was the hardest part because people immediately knew that Danielle was talking about her ex Ethan in the video since she was quick enough to defend Mikey by saying that it wasn't him while Ethan on the other hand had to hand his comments to avoid people asking him questions three years after this situation went down with people still holding grudges against Ethan Danielle decided to link up with her ex Ethan after she got a commercial for her body care brand and y'all the entire internet went in shambles afterwards since they didn't expect Danielle to rekindle her friendship with Ethan especially after what he did to her and the Damage he caused her in the past after the whole pregnancy thing she goes back she always goes back after all he put her through a damn shame after tons of people dragged Danielle for embarrassing herself again by rekindling her friendship with Ethan Danielle decided to release a statement afterwards talking about the situation where she claimed that they're both friends now and are on good terms and that they both handled the situation wrong in the past and they regret putting each other in danger even though not that many people agreed with Danielle's decision it seems that her ex Mason was very supportive of Dany after he stepped in for the picture of Danny and Ethan with a comment saying his obsession with Danielle is seriously unreal anyways y'all let's move on now to the one and only Bryce Hall who not only got into a fight with multiple security guards but also got charged with two battery misdemeanors damn how many times did this man get into a fight with the security guards throughout this entire decade I'm genuinely so sick and tired of him not gonna lie you guys my life has been so great ever since I stopped talking about Bryce Hall in my videos I mean this man was literally causing chaos in The Tick Tock Community for years and despite some of them genuinely being so entertaining he did end up ruining his reputation over and over again just like he did back in 2017 at his Peak back in 2020 Bryce got into multiple public fights with security guards restaurant employees and even regular people and of course we all know know how that went since some of them tried filing a lawsuit against Bryce While others accused him of saying slurs and we all know how that went down at that time oh it just seemed that Bryce didn't care about his image he was putting of himself to the media and just from these videos alone you can tell the type of person he is forward to this here you guys we expected things to change with price but unfortunately this man just keeps getting worse and worse after he recently got into a serious fight in Las Vegas this week where he attempted to fight two security guards for kicking him out of a nightclub okay hey he's not a fighter he never claimed to be yeah this wasn't some type of high school publicity stunt type of fight because according to TMZ the person who videotaped the entire fight Bryce allegedly got charged with two battery misdemeanors over the fight that he had with the security guards and from what we've seen Bryce has neither addressed the situation publicly nor been active on social media ever since the fight went down Bryce was finally becoming funny and not annoying then he goes and does this he'll never change always fighting somebody alcohol ain't your friend Bryce the way he is gonna make tick tocks about this and get millions of likes because that's what his fans like to watch please lock him up forever speaking of Bryce getting sued let's just end today's video with Mala trevejo also getting sued by ex-staffers for abusive and racist treatment it hasn't even been a couple of days since we talked about Mal trevejo and here she is getting exposed and sued by her ex-staffers for being racist and abusive I love how the tables turn sometimes if you guys have missed my previous videos on Malo trevejo well unfortunately this girl had some serious words to say on the internet last week after she got called out for lip syncing the n-word in her recent Tick Tock video and instead of mallow apologizing for offending the entire black community she went on a rant instead talking about how she's more Egyptian than Latino which excuses her from saying the n-word Egyptian that makes so much sense right now alive are you [ __ ] were providing me for saying that word in this whole time I'm learning more black than what I am Spanish it's crazy other than this she even posted the DNA test that she received to prove to people that she's more Egyptian I don't understand the type of clownery she was trying to pull us on but thankfully Karma hit her hard this week after Rolling Stone released an article talking about how malu's ex-staffers are suing her for abusive treatment the article went on to expose mallow for her rude Behavior towards her staff after they claimed that she was using her position of power to inflict emotional mental and verbal abuse upon her staff and this info came according to a new civil lawsuit filed in Miami against Mal trevejo and her company in addition to this the former employees who are seeking at least 4 million in Damages are also suing mallow for battery defamation and sexual misconduct among other complaints this is what the ex-staffers revealed in their lawsuit one major complaint in the lawsuit centers around trevejo's alleged emotional and verbal abuse of her employees if her team didn't respond to her texts and calls quickly enough including frequent in middle of the night calls or adequately anticipate her needs trevejo became livid at these perceived failures the former staffers claim she'd allegedly lash out calling them stupid dumb and use racial and homophobic slurs of course an attorney for Malo denied the allegations immediately in a statement to Rolling Stones saying that Malu is aware of the false allegations in the lawsuit and she's looking forward to defending herself against these baseless claims but the media had different opinions on the situation and well just take a look at what some had to say about it this girl been getting away with this for so long and people really think she's innocent I hope the ex-staffers get their Justice for real one thing about Karma it will always get you when you least expect it makes sense now why she had that breakdown on live after being robbed and blackmailed it probably had something to do with this lawsuit Gurley knew her downfall was coming anyways loves if you need more juicy videos on these influencers then don't forget to click on the tab right above 
01/09/2023,TikToker WASTE Food For Money & Views..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plse26qEwes,83-11,spaghetti spaghetti sauce meatballs I hate people that waste food why do you have to waste food on Tick Tock no thanks a little bit it's like the more food you waste the more views it gets why it's not funny you're just being completely wasteful we all know that there are tons of people who spend their entire lives dreaming of becoming famous it sometimes even gets to the point where views and follows become an addiction that fuels the drive to keep making content a lot of these people fall into this problem because they want their talents and passions to be admired and appreciated whether they're an aspiring pop star or a super talented artist or just a content creator millions of people constantly strive to just have that one video go viral which would make them an overnight sensation but not every one of these people are actually talented in fact there are so many wannabe influencers who do some of the most outrageous stuff just to get attention from licking toilet seats to faking entire diseases but one of the most popular methods used by such people is wasting food in today's video I'm going to be showing you guys two content creators who manage to make some of the most obnoxious blood boiling content that I have ever seen literally the trend of wasting food was made big by a tick-tocker called wassail who would create content about how much he loved food except most people expressed their love for food by making videos documenting what they eat in a day or by showing themselves cooking mouth-watering meals wasil on the other hand expressed his love by making content like this I don't even get what he's trying to do however while Sil is really the first person to gain attention for wasting food but there is another tick tocker who has taken this trend to a whole nother level and that is topper Guild here is just one example of the videos that topper Guild has made topper Guild not only wastes food but also a huge amount of money I mean you guys can all see that there is a brand new looking iPhone just sitting on his kitchen counter that he didn't think for one second to maybe move it before it got completely drenched in soy sauce the craziest part about this though to me is that sometimes he actually tries to turn his videos into some sort of attempt at comedy but like I can't imagine how anyone would find this funny seriously though imagine living in poverty and you go into your local Costco to try and find something super cheap so that you can have something to eat for the day and then you see this guy in another aisle with a cart that is literally just full of milk soy sauce and whatever else now imagine going home and logging into Tick Tock to try and escape from reality and then this same guy comes up on your for you page flooding his entire kitchen with an amount of food that could feed an entire town but he doesn't even take more than one bite the worst part about this though is that somehow topper Guild has not won not two but 30 million people who have for some reason found his content entertaining enough to follow him on top of making super cringe content and wasting an extraordinary amount of food topper is also known for basically being one of the biggest cloud chasers on Tick Tock and he does this by directly stealing content from other creators I mean he literally got the idea of wasting food from Marcel who I mentioned earlier and to make matters worse you can tell completely that he got the idea from wisselle because he makes fun out of his accent birthday however this is where things start to take an interesting turn as recently topper has made a dramatic shift in his content that had shocked a ton of people but let's be honest some people on the internet are extremely gullible and I think topper knows that basically for some context around a year ago was still decided to make a big change to the kind of content he was making if you scroll down to the bottom of his account you'll see the usual over-the-top videos of him wasting ingredients to make a 15 second video however if you scroll up to the top of his page you'll see his most recent videos are of him trying out viral Tick-Tock hacks and overall content that is slightly less boring but a whole lot less wasteful and annoying but what prompted was still to make this Sudden Change well he basically got an overwhelming amount of hate the backlash got so bad that he made an apology video explaining that because he now has a large following he no longer wants to make content that could spread a harmful message but now I realize that I have a very big audience and anything that I can record on camera kind of have consequences as far as uh the messaging that I'm putting out there and I just want to say that this video is in no way an excuse for any of my actions that I put out this is simply to say that I was wrong and that I'm sorry I mean it's cool that he became self-aware and apologized for his actions or whatever but like at the same time the only reason he got his platform in the first place was because he took advantage of people online who somehow found his content entertaining so you might be wondering what this has to do with topper Guild well as I mentioned before topper doesn't seem to have a single creative or original bone in his body and when he saw that his biggest inspiration had switched things up topper decided to do the same a tick tocker called Milad went viral for making videos in response to topper in which he would show a clip of topper making his usual food wasting content and then Milad would show himself buying a ton of food but instead of being a complete idiot he would hand out his meals for free to local homeless people just take a look [Music] foreign [Music] this is such a great way to make content that is both engaging and also super beneficial to the lives of others it also pulls in millions of views which is exactly why toppergill decided to copy milad's content as soon as he saw how popular it was getting when I say copying I don't just mean he took the concept of handing out food to homeless people I mean he literally copies pretty much every single scene and uses the exact same audio [Music] man cause sometimes [Music] when people watched Topper's new video they were literally shocked and he received a ton of Praise in his comments by verified creators for finally making a change one Creator wrote thanks for being you bro maybe these other creators can take notes and another user put finally you learned it's great that he's doing something good for other people even if he does it while a man stands behind him recording people that probably don't want to be filmed but saying that he's learned his lesson or that he's changed is a bit of a reach and I'm so happy that I'm not the only one that noticed how obvious it was that topper had seen his views going down while my Lads were going up and decided to piggyback off of his content to keep himself somehow relevant bro this makes more views changed because he understood it's not trending anymore and people are hating on him and he's getting no views some people have made the argument that even if topper is just making the videos because they get him more views at least he's making a positive impact on people's lives and while I agree that it's a much better decision to feed the Homeless than to cover your kitchen Florence cereal I don't think topper should be redeemed from his past just because he gave out a couple of sandwiches there are thousands of Charities that provide free meals for homeless people every single day that don't need to carry around cameras to film their interactions to make themselves look good online what do you guys think do you feel like topper has changed or is he just another Tick-Tock clout Chaser let me know and I'll see you all in my next video [Music]

Cooper Noriega,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHPN3tHF-s0,14-21,and all the viewers and fans who loved and supported cooper throughout his lifetime this is what you need to know about cooper who not only got mistreated and misunderstood by the entire world but also gave tons of support to his friends and his fans despite him being at his worst cooper noriega is a well-known tick-tocker who blew up a couple of years ago on the platform after he gained major popularity for his lip-syncing dancing and modeling videos but the difference between cooper and other tick-tockers is that he was also working on his social media accounts before tick tock in fact he is known for making music and releasing them on spotify and he's also a very skilled guitarist so before cooper became successful and switched his career to become a tick-tock influencer he had already completed his early schooling at a local high school in the u.s after that he enrolled himself at a local private university in the united states where he pursued his higher education along with his professional career it was tough for cooper to manage both university and his social media life at the same time and it's still unknown whether cooper actually dropped out of college or not but one thing we can't deny is that since childhood cooper had an interest in dancing and modeling in fact he always wanted to pursue his career as a dancer or a model in the entertainment industry and that's why he found a way to follow his dream career by going on tick tock and posting videos for millions of people to see of course...

08/16/2022,The Pink Sauce Tiktok Scam That EVERYONE Fell For…,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDKxjwaEGJo,13-15,in the last few months tick tock has started up a new feature on the social media platform called tick-tock shop which as the name suggests creates a digital marketplace where vendors can sell their products directly through social media this feature has literally taken tick tock from being a kid's dancing app to basically being a telemarketing company since users can find a product and link it in their video telling all of their followers to buy it which is heavily encouraged through the tick tock app paying these people a small amount of commission if someone buys a product through their link the tick tock shop is probably one of the most polarizing ventures that i have ever seen a social media platform take since you can actually find some amazing deals such as discounted cosmetics and skincare products but then there are also some things that make me really question the thought process of some of the vendors as on the other side of things you can also buy things like an entire rotisserie chicken and extremely cheap energy drinks and in today's video we're going to be talking about one of the most controversial products that has been sold through tick tock it has captured the attention of thousands of people but for all the wrong reasons so without further ado let's take a look into the pink sauce controversy so upon hearing the name above you probably have no idea what the pink sauce could be apart from obviously a sauce that resembles the color of unicorns and...
