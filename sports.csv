01/11/2024,The Ace Family Is Done ... filed for divorce,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLhmbtKXQ10,205-11, something I honestly didn't think I would ever see has been announced and that is that the ace family is getting a divorce and from what Catherine wrote it sounded like she was divorcing Austin but we're going to get into how it's a little complicated after Austin's post but that is what the initial impression was from a lot of people now given everything that's happened with them online all the things that have been said about Austin the things that have come out about his family some might think that they saw it coming but Catherine has been extreme loyal to the MC Brom family over the years staying by Austin through cheating allegations and so much more that I truly didn't think this would ever be news I'd see announced but Catherine posted on Instagram sharing the news writing as I start this New Year I will challenge myself in ways that I have never done before 2024 will be my year of transformative change and with this taking place one of the steps in my journey is the difficult decision to leave my marriage we have mutually agreed to a divorce and will part amicably our paths as a couple have shifted and has created challenges that are irreconcilable this decision comes with a very heavy heart as heartbreaking as this is I also feel liberated I have spent the past few years prioritizing my children and honoring my commitment to my family all the while I seem to be losing myself and my own personal happiness our main priority will be to stay United as parents and to continue creating a stable happy and loving environment for our children thank you to all of my supporters for giving me a safe space to be able to use my voice and share our love I love you all so much and I'm beyond grateful for all the support we've received from you throughout all these years as a couple and Austin you're my best friend and that will never change seriously some shocking stuff here I mean I was not expecting the ace family to post on social media that they were getting a divorce I really didn't especially because they've been especially quiet this year with hardly any posts on on social media they're not posting on YouTube and I guess this explains why but this is just wild Austin also ended up poting on Instagram which his post followed Catherine's and honestly from hers I felt like she divorced him but he's kind of writing the same thing in his post so I don't really know who left who they're mutually agreeing to it allegedly but he wrote for this new year I'll be taking a leap of faith I've made the hardest decision of my life the decision to close the book to my marriage we we have mutually agreed to a divorce but will remain a team when it comes to our kids we created one of the greatest stories almost a decade together so many memories so many accomplishments but every book comes to an end and now we will be writing a new book as separate authors we both understand that holding on is believing that there is only a past and letting go is knowing that there is a future and we both are supporting each other's Futures this transition is not easy but we both are making it as easy as it can be for our family we will continue to be the best parents to our kids separations are difficult and most times messy but you will see how we push through these difficult times as a unit and keep influencing with love and positivity with that being said 2024 will be lifechanging for me I will be dedicated to myself my kids my health my body my mind my spirit and God thank you to everyone who has supported us through our journey and who will continue to support us moving forward we're going to need even more of your love and strength during this time I noticed that back in November Catherine did post a photo on Instagram of herself with the caption set free and someone even wondered if this was hinting at them no longer being together commenting did she break up with Austin and it looks like that was probably the reason she was saying what she did in the caption and probably also explains why Austin has so freely been messaging only fans girls in the DMS because recently I talked about the fact that several only fans models had exposed Austin for hitting them up in the DMS it seems like he was trying to run their social media and only fan accounts for cut of their earnings as this new business that he was starting up which everyone was pretty much under the assumption that him and Catherine were in on this together or him and his family and this was their new business because they're always trying to do some new business since the last couple have just not worked out and he hasn't been boxing because he's just not been cleared to fight at least that's what he said the last time they ever posted a video so everyone just thought all right this is what they're trying to do to make money now and nobody was suspicious that they possibly have broken up at least not about this because it's obviously come out before that he's been in girls DMS or message people or been hanging out with people there's been cheating allegations a ton over the years so it was not that big of a red flag for people I mean obviously a very big red flag if he's like messaging other girls but it wasn't that alarming that they would be divorcing when this news came out just because she stuck by him all the other times but I suppose this explains a little bit more as to why he was in their DMS because he is a single man now and they're divorced so he could do this shamelessly without feeling bad obviously it looks bad because nobody knew but I mean now we know I guess still a pretty sketchy situation though because of the way that he was messaging these girls asking if they were signed to an agency and he's asking them this because he wants a cut of whatever checks they are getting in from only fans and people have talked about how this is a scam going around where guys want to you know take over girls accounts for more money and it just ends up being a scam where they don't get money at the end of the day and that's been a really big Trend with Austin and his family so him doing this it's still a total red flag and I don't know who would be trusting him to run their account but I hope there's not girls taking this offer married or not just seems like a bad deal to be working with the MC Brom family now some were surprised to even hear that these two were getting a divorce because some didn't even know that they were married but they have been married for quite a while now and they never had a wedding party they just got married in private after a scandal that they had I believe that it was a cheating scandal and they kind of weren't posting for a minute there and then they came back and said that they were married but they kept on saying that they were going to have this big extravagant wedding at some point and they had postponed a wedding that they planned in 2022 because Austin had a fight that got rescheduled on the same day as their wedding so they canel the wedding in order for Austin to fight that day and they never ended up rescheduling their wedding the last video on their YouTube channel is literally them talking about the fact that they wanted to do this huge big Royal Wedding type of Celebration and be able to live stream it to their fans including all of them in this day for them but that was the last video posted onto their Channel and now we can see why nothing ever came of that we have big plans for this wedding we don't want to do this wedding like on a low level we want to take it here we want to take it like and with this wedding you know comes obviously a lot of planning we're trying to make it the biggest wedding ever like I know the Royals are like up there like and we're like this close to get we want to have a really beautiful massive ceremonial like everybody invited like you guys get to watch it put this way put it this way we don't want to do this thing small and put it on YouTube no offense to you YouTube but just by saying that you guys know we're trying to take this wedding okay sorry to be so fun but I just feel like if you guys have been watching us and investing your time and loving us and supporting us for so many years and I feel like you should be able to watch it live just saying so I want to make that like a big production like I said I don't want it to be this business thing but like it kind of is but it's not like as of the last couple of weeks these two still have been posting each other on Snapchat though so I don't think many fans really thought that that this news was coming now what I will say is that I think this could be a career rebirth for Catherine I know divorces are hard and sad and obviously involve a lot of emotion and it is a sensitive subject but truly I do think that so many people would be willing to support Catherine online separated from Austin although she was involved in a lot of the ace family drama from the lies that they told to the scams Austin's family was behind a lot of the deals the contracts I think Catherine really went along with everything still responsible for everything but I do think that a lot of people would be willing to hear her out if she posted a video and was honest or even if she didn't want to open up about whatever went down while they were together if she just started posting wherever on social media more aside from Snapchat just down to earth nor normal not schemy money hungry feeling content I think it could be a whole new world for her that she could open up I think Austin has dug himself a hole and his brother is right there in that hole with him along with their dad and they just come off so desperate to squeeze out every last dollar that they can get without any regard for other people and if Catherine can prove herself to not be like that I think truly people would support her I posted a Tik Tok right when she announced their divorce and all of the comments are cheering her on saying good for her so I seriously think that this could be something totally lifechanging in a good way for her but I want to know what you guys think obviously we've talked about the ace family for a really long time now and I don't know what's going to happen with their Channel if they're just going to leave the channel as like some time capsule for them and then start their own channels or if Catherine will finally start the channel that she's been talking about forever that a lot of people have been asking for a lot of the ace family members a lot of the people that watch her on Snapchat have asked her to start her own YouTube channel and it just never happened I don't know if it was because Austin was holding her back or what but I do think that if she did start and posted content on there people would go to it but it could be wrong but it's just the feeling that I'm getting based off the comment section of people feeling really happy that she was able to break away from this family but let me know what you guys think in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye [Music] guys
06/24/2023,The Truth Behind Dance Moms Is Much Darker Than You Think..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLjJk4bGl9g,160-13, you guys Dance Moms was a mess from start to finish and I'm sure you've heard a lot about some of the things that have gone down but it's truly shocking how traumatizing this show was for the girls from bullying and inappropriate performances to actual racism the show literally had it all so let's just get into the dark history of how Dance Moms turned into hell for all contestants involved alright guys if you didn't know the show is based around Abby Lee Miller's dance school and let me tell you it is absolutely ruthless over the course of eight seasons not only have so many of the girls who participated in the show come out to say that they need trauma therapy now but a lot of them have also confessed that they've developed massive confidence issues remember Ava Michelle from tall girl and how everyone made fun of her yeah she was on Dance Moms and literally got kicked out by Abby for being too tall it's all for us today you're cut thank you you can go is that clear enough for you now that's a Full Circle moment one time she even asked a mom to fix her daughter's ears because she thought they were too big Abby do you want some cake yourself [Music] Abby I can't even believe you just did that and this was just because Abby's team lost to those girls it's not even the only time that Abby has gone too far insulting someone since she actually caused one of the most dramatic moments of the show when she insulted one of the girls Chloe because she didn't like that she had won over another girl Abby didn't hold anything back and told her mom to get Chloe's eye which had a medical condition fixed Chloe's mom went absolutely crazy on Abby for the comment and it was actually so bad that the show had to edit the footage so that Abby calls Chloe washed up instead your kids washed up how dare you do you know anything about that kid no how low of a human being can she be this isn't about dance this is about human decency and how low can you go and I don't think anybody's lower than Abby Abby's comments actually got her into a real fight once where one of the moms Kelly not only slapped her but also started pulling her hair I said Brooke Brooke and guys this all happened right in front of all the girls which was absolutely not allowed to happen basically Abby was ruthless in body shaming these girls and if you weren't perfect enough for her then you were out there have been so many examples of this over the years but some of them have been really too much Mia especially was one of the girls that took some of the worst hits since it looked like Abby was always after her no matter what she did Mia was especially singled out when it comes to this and Abby never held back with her comments one time she even accused her of not working enough at home which is why her thighs were too fat I can see by the fact in the air your mouth y'all these were getting aggressive over these things and all that screaming is just a normal day in the studio for these people a lot of people also pointed out how Abby's comments towards Neo were often very unnecessary and super pointed since she never said the same things about the other girls who were around Mia's size and let me also point out that Nia was already really skinny on the show so it always felt super unfair even Presley from the last season went through something similar where Abby literally told her that nobody wants to see those sides and put a huge skirt on her to try and hide her legs I can't even imagine how many insecurities that alone created but no girl was free from her Terror when it came to how much they weigh since Abby admitted that she would literally write up each girl's weight on a board every morning in order to hold the girls in check a lot of people thought this was absolutely disgusting and even the moms have protested because of how unnecessary it is Abby also revealed that she used to make the girls dance with 10 pound bags of actual potatoes so they could feel what it's like to have gained 10 pounds I used to make the kids do grungitase which are leaps across the floor carrying 10-pound bags of potatoes Jesus like yeah and Kelly Highland also exposed her for telling the girls to suck in their stomachs all the time and that she would even name the girl's stomachs if they were showing anything but it completely flat stomach Abby's comments ranged from anything to do with weight to just her straight up criticizing the girls for no reason I just watched you you were completely turned in on your foot pigeon toed this kid is Pigeon took I'm telling you and her mother never got a corrective shoes and they didn't break those ankles and turn around instead of giving constructive dance criticism it was always just to bring the girls down and at one point the moms just refused to take it anymore and used Abby's own tactics against her they for real brought out a whiteboard and marked every single time Abby would make a negative comment about a girl like guys this show is so messy for years the moms have talked about the unfair treatment Abby displays towards the girls so we have a whiteboard Abby Mark and aboard indicates and reflects something negative Abby has said or done towards our girls and there's no hiding from these numbers there's no hiding from the truth and let's just say you guys she was not happy about getting that kind of treatment this is my teaching method and your teaching is not good as flawed as we have seen this has nothing more miles who was missing out on the whole Abby Lee experience but guys let me also point out that these moms aren't any better when it comes to body shaming since they are constantly hating on Abby's weight whenever they get mad about something she's done he has more class than her little finger 13 than you have that big fat body at 45. like that's not okay and a lot of people have pointed out that there are plenty of other things to hate on that woman for thankfully The Dance Moms did end up seeing the problem with their behavior and have actually come out to say that they regret every comment they made about her weight and would never say such things again Abby on the other hand let's just say she rarely has any regrets however guys Abby's Behavior didn't just end at comments since she also made the girls do a lot of super inappropriate things for the show so much of the criticism she received over the years was based around the fact that she'd come up with these dances and outfits that were never appropriate for children to do and she never listened or back down a super controversial instance was when she decided to make the girls do a show girl themed dance that means making the girls do a super sensual dance that was literally meant to appease to men and even said that she wanted to give the the illusion of them being nude this probably also was when she made one of her most inappropriate comments ever that genuinely shocked me when I heard it and I wanted to make sure that my girls learned the proper technique because someday one of them is going to be a showgirl I cannot believe she said that guys and it is so crazy that this was aired on TV and guys this episode got so much backlash from people anyone who defends this belongs in prison because this seriously is not okay and I'm glad they stopped airing this there are so many messed up people in this world and this show should not be putting these children in dangerous situations like this and let me not even mention the way that she made the girls dress for the actual performance they barely had any clothes on the worst part is that that isn't even the only time Abby has done something like this and there have been several instances where even the moms had to say no like the time that Abby made them dress up in school girl outfits with fishnets I wish I was joking you guys I don't understand how she thought it was appropriate in any way shape or form and even the moms called her out for it thankfully she did end up removing the fishnets but the whole concept was still so uncalled for but y'all Abby's strict rules go Way Beyond commenting on the girl's appearance or performance since she was often found being very racist towards the black girls on the show not that there have been many either from the original cast Nia was the only black girl and it was very clear that she was being treated very differently probably one of the most memorable moments from the entire show was when she singled Nia out in front of all the girls and told her mom to fix her hair because her braids were horrible and weighing her down which made her mom Furious that [Music] in your body and everything else and that's fine when I turned jewelry I'll do a start critiquing people let's start with you look in the mirror according to Nia's mom she had gotten approval from the studio to get her hair braided which means Abby was just being difficult and hateful on purpose another Super sketchy situation concerning Mia was when Abby decided they were going to do a Rosa Parks inspired dance for a competition and then acted like the only black girl in the room wouldn't necessarily get the role don't assume anything I have no idea who will play Rosa Parks she has to give it her all before I'm even gonna let her know that the part is hers I'm annoyed here is finally apart from Nia and Abby's playing games the scene has been called out many times with people saying how absolutely unnecessary it was for Abby to act like the role wouldn't go to her when every other kid in there was white and it just felt plain disrespectful and what's even worse is the fact that Kendall's mom somehow thought that she could get the role for Kendall since it wasn't decided yet I mean she literally walked up to Abby and asked her if Kendall could play Rosa Parks so Abby what's the status with Rosa Parks have you seen the number long enough to figure out who's gonna I just started the number I didn't even get the props in the street that's why I asked what the status is what are you thinking about it I can't believe Jill's lobbying for her daughter to take this part away from Nia let me also mention the fact that Abby was also encouraging this for some reason all because she thought Nia getting the role to too easy Nia needs to think she has competition I can't just hand it to her on a platter thankfully the other moms did convince Kendall's mom to back off and to tell Abby that she was wrong and that Nia obviously deserves this role but Abby wasn't happy about the backtracking either since to her it meant that she could put another child above her own which is apparently a huge no like the situation was so crazy guys I can't even anyways Abby's weird racist Behavior didn't stop with Nia since she continued this act even in season 8 when other black girls joined their moms decided that Abby's Act was too much and decided to expose her racism online Cameron's mom Adriana posted on Instagram and revealed how Abby would make extremely targeted comments to her when the cameras were off like when she said I know you grew up in the hood with only a box of eight crayons but I grew up in the country club with a box of 64. don't be stupid and guys her mom decided to expose all of this back in 2020 when the Black lives matter protests were everywhere and because Abby was one of the people to do the performative blackout Square thing on Instagram it's very clear that Abby has no room to speak when it comes to the issue since she had never once apologized for any of her racist comments at the time which is why Adriana felt that she had to speak out she even revealed some shocking information since Abby had apparently full-on admitted to her that Cameron was only on the show because she was black she wrote do you remember when you told me do you want me to tell you why you are really here you told me to look in the mirror that's the only reason why you are here cam told me she heard they need a Sprinkle of color and not only is that absolutely devastating to hear for a little girl but her mom apparently really understood the gravity of what was happening and decided they had to leave it's perfectly understandable why she chose to pull her daughter from the show and even if Cameron did protest at first not fully understanding why these things were so bad she eventually realized how serious things were when her mom started crying in front of her Adriana ended the message with people need to be held accountable not just for the injustices but also for being a closet racist today I am tired of being silent because of a contract the incredibly powerful message from her ended up being one of the reasons that the show actually got canceled which just speaks to how messed up the whole thing was and guys she even inspired another mom to speak up another girl on the show who was also named Cameron but with a c went through a very similar thing and her mom Camille decided that enough was enough and exposed Abby's Behavior Abby tried to spin Cameron as being the poor one and they're on scholarship I shut that down immediately she loves appropriating our culture and never appreciating it she did not give black choreographers on the show acknowledgment of their work she continuously put Cameron in afros everything she said was completely true and Abby has always done that kind of stuff on the show which was again proved when nikaya Wiley who was sometimes on the show actually spoke up for herself she said my mom has been saying this for years about Abby Kathy and several moms but nobody listened because she was viewed as angry and aggressive why do you think she was always so angry she was called a black ghetto hood rat and heard Abby and Kathy making comments about my body Nakaya also mentioned how all of those comments were always cut from the show but her mom's reaction to them never was which just works to paint her mom as aggressive and angry so this whole racism problem wasn't only happening with the cast but was also very much present with the production I think it's safe to say there's a reason the show didn't continue now Abby did end up apologizing after Adriana spoke up about Cameron saying I genuinely understand and deeply regret how my words have affected and hurt those around me in the past particularly those in the black community to Cameron Adriana and anyone else I've heard I am truly sorry I realize that racism can come not just from hate but also from ignorance Abby also promised to educate herself and grow and that she wanted to show genuine change but as it turns out you guys Adriana doesn't accept her apology she claims that Abby apology wasn't sincere and that if she really meant it then she would have reached out to her daughter directly which she hadn't she literally had to find out about Abby's apology from a friend and to her it just didn't seem genuine she also explained how this is so much bigger than just her and Cameron and how it's something that affects all fields of dance which is why it is so important to her Camille also commented on Abby's statement even if it didn't mention anything about her and her daughter Cameron but she basically called Abby out for only apologizing because of the political climate at the time and because her money was now being affected she said she's had years to apologize for the things she said to Cameron if she was truly repentant then she should put her money where her mouth is give some scholarships to underprivileged black children stop appropriating her culture and simply learn about systemic racism and how she had benefited from it and complicit in it so yeah guys because of everything that went down and all the black moms speaking up about their children's mistreatment and all the backlash Abby got from treating the girls so badly the show did end up end ending after season eight and another show that Abby had planned with the network Abby's virtual dance-off also ended up getting canceled and let's just say people fully believe she got what she deserved she was one of the vilest women on TV the way she treated those girls no one would ever treat or speak to my child like that without getting punched the F out sorry I don't condone violence but she would drive you to it some of the girls from the show have actually spoken out a lot about what actually went down and a lot of it is truly disturbing Cameron with a c even made a YouTube video about it where she talked about what kind of struggle she went through and it truly sounds like the whole thing was a nightmare for her not only did she talk about how sick her mom was of the show and how she was treated by the other moms but she also revealed that she really felt like nobody there ever cared about any of them she also mentioned how the show constantly made it seem like she never wanted to be there just to create drama which according to her wasn't true at all but because of the constant hate she got for it it really did push her to not want to be on the show the cast and crew have continued to say that the show was never scripted but a lot of them Cameron included have revealed that the producers always set up situations to fit their narrative and made sure that things would happen even if there wasn't a script which is why people pointed out that the show decided they wanted to portray Cameron and her mom a certain way and it literally drove them to act how they wanted which ended up being heavily criticized the worst thing is that even if they all realized that they were being manipulated into doing things they literally had to play into it or they wouldn't get paid she would just sit there and not say anything so her words wouldn't get twisted or anything like that and the producer straight up was like could be don't talk if you don't fight you're not getting a check this week and she was just like this also meant that a lot of the times the moms would actually fight on purpose just to make the producers happy and not to be forced into situations that they didn't choose to be in so the whole thing was basically arranged and Cameron and her mom were definitely big victims of it Cameron even mentioned how Abby would talk down to her all the time and how her racist comments could be apparently she even went as far as commenting on her skin on camera she's like you so if you're freaking terrible your feet are absolutely horrible one time she told me that the bottom of my feet looked weird because the top of my feet were Brown and the bottom were white and none of the other peoples were like that and she was like it looks weird on the modeling and I'm just like so yeah guys with everything that happened and every inappropriate and even racist thing that Abby did to the girls as well as the drama that was created for no reason I totally get why everyone was celebrating when the show was canceled anyways loves I would love to hear your guys thoughts on these situations down below and don't forget to check out this video for more drama

11/09/2022,Drag Queens Who Deserved To Win,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBHvrPiYW-8,206-11, hi besties with all the winners that we've had so far within all of the drag race franchises it's safe to say that we all have our opinions on which queens were deserving of their wins well all these Queens have worked extremely hard to take home the crowd there are a few that have been extremely deserving of the title so looking at all of these winning Queens let's talk about the ones who were the most deserving of taking home the crown shall we Bianca Del Rio is an obvious choice of a winning Queen who was extremely deserving of the crown Bianca was the winner of the sixth season of drag race and she was by far the clear winner of that season wow I love Courtney Act and Adore Delano Bianca screamed winner throughout the entire season she is talented in so many ways she knows her way around a sewing machine and knows fashion she can act and of course she's hilarious it seemed like every challenge was for her a walk in the park and she never had to lip sync for her life once the entire season after drag race she is by far one of the most successful Queens ever since taking home the crown she's been on several sold out comedy tours starred in her own movies and has had one of the best careers for a queen coming off the show with all of the talents that Bianca has along with her time on the show I definitely consider Bianca to be one of the most deserving winners of RuPaul's Drag Race history and certainly one of the obvious choices then of course is Bob the drag queen who is another obvious choice as one of the most deserving winners to ever take home the crown alongside Bianca Bob was the winner of the eighth season of drag race and throughout the season he definitely seemed like the obvious choice to be America's Next drag Superstar Bob was a force to be reckoned with during the competition as he slayed effortlessly just like Bianca Bob used comedy to his advantage and quickly became a fan favorite Bob also had a career that absolutely flourished after he took home the crown he was big on his comedy and had a comedy special along with appearing in a show called we're here on HBO alongside Eureka O'Hara and Shangela he is also really involved with social justice fighting for lgbtq rights along with the black lives matter movement Bob is one of the most talented Queens to ever grace the drag race stage and there's really no wonder why he's one of the most favorite Queens to me that makes him one of the most deserving winners in Drag Race her story another obvious choice in my opinion would be Jinx Monsoon who most recently became a two-time winner as she took home the crown on season five as well as the seventh season of All-Stars and all winners season Jinx has so much talent that it's literally insane there's a reason why she was able to win twice I could go on for days talking about all of the reasons why Jinx deserved to take home the crown two times throughout the competition both times she proved time and time again why she is a winner she overcame bullying from the other queens I'm looking at you Alaska talks and kept her head held high on both of her Seasons she killed it when it came to the snatch game and had so many people talking with her hilarious portrayal of Judy Garland I think both times that Jinx was on drag race she had everyone rooting for her including the judges and that by far makes her one of the most deserving winners to ever win twice taking a step away from the American version of drag race I think that Carmen faralla the very first winner of drag race Espana is extremely deserving of her win one of the obvious reasons that she deserved to win was the fact that she was a dominating force on the show as she won three Maxi challenges and was never in the bottom two throughout the entire competition thanks to all of her incredible Talent she captured the hearts of so many fans as well as the judges which made her the obvious choice to take home the crown she set the bar so high with her performances that many fans thought that she was the deserving winner from the very beginning and with that being said I'd have to agree going back to the American version of drag race I'd have to say that Raja is another queen that deserved her win Raja made her way into our hearts when she took home the title of America's Next drag Superstar during season three throughout the competition Raja showed us what it meant to be a superstar to me it seemed like she was meant to be the winner of her season she showed that she had everything it took to be America's Next drag Superstar not to mention her drag and her knowledge of fashion and ability to see and create outfits was literally otherworldly I have never seen another queen really show as much extensive knowledge of fashion that Rogers does when she came back for All-Star 7 the all winter season she showed the world that she still got it despite winning drag race over a decade another queen that was so incredibly worthy of her win was our very first queen to ever take home the crown baby Zahara Benet in case you've forgotten Bibi was the very first winner in RuPaul's Drag Race history throughout the competition she showed everyone that she was deserving of the very first title I think Bibi is one of the best winners to ever win because she emulates everything that a great drag queen should have the way she holds herself with such poisoned Elegance is enough reason to consider her to be deserving of the crown I think she set the standard for other queens and future winners and will always remember her for that Switching gears I want to discuss the Vivian the very first winner of RuPaul's Drag Race UK I consider Viv to be very similar in regards to Bibi since she was the first winner of her franchise Vivian set the standard for so many other queens and she will continue to do so for years to come throughout her season the Vivian showed everyone why she deserved to win she's so incredibly talented and was able to tackle any and all challenges effortlessly she can tick any box and show off any skill that mamaRoo would ask for it also helps that she's gorgeous and hilarious too the Vivian is also known for having one of the best snatch game performances and again she set the standard for other queens on drag race UK with her portrayal of Donald Trump Viv deserved to take home the crown and she will always lead by example when it comes to other queens on drag race UK who want to give the competition a shot another winner that deserved her win is a more recent winner and that is Simone from the 13th season of drag race while there were so many talented Queens on that particular season Simone deserved her win by far simply because of the way she slayed the competition and held herself throughout during the competition Simone was so hard on herself she held herself to such a high standard and really strives for Perfection well she might have gotten in her head a little bit she proved that she was strong and beat the odds to take home the crown I think that Simone has an electric personality and her Charisma is off the charts which also helped her secure her win she chose off so many boxes I really think that she was the easiest choice when it came to picking a winner Simone was the most deserving of her win hands down when you sit back and think about it there have been so many winners of drag race and all of its franchises already well we can sit here and debate for ages about all of the winners and whether or not they deserved to win I think that these queens that we talked about today are the best of the best and deserved their wins no questions asked that being said what do you think are these Queens worthy of their wins did I miss anyone let me know what you think in the comments

08/02/2022,How Abby Lee Miller TRAUMATIZED Maddie Ziegler..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7g27RrJOhs,31-22,Dance Moms was one of the most popular reality TV shows of the 2010s it followed dance teacher Abby Lee Miller as she coached her young students in her Pennsylvania studio and as the title suggests it also follows the dancer's mothers and all of the drama that comes with being a full-time Dance Mom there were arguments but also happy moments however despite it being extremely popular this did not mean that it was met without controversy and several ex-students of the dance company have since severed their ties to Abby who was once almost like a second mother saying that the teacher had left them with lifelong trauma in today's video we're going to take a look at the show and what made it so successful and also what led to its fiery downfall Dance Moms first episode aired in July of 2011 and we saw the process of Abby Lee Miller training her students up to then travel to various competitions each week however even though the girls at the studio were extremely talented Abby's teaching style was found to be very questionable she would aggressively Shout at the girls some of which were only seven years old and belittle them and even famously said that she had a talent for making kids cry another one of her weird Antics was called the weekly pyramid where Abby would gather the girls together and rank them from worst to best this also showed her favoritism towards certain girls like Maddie the other problem with this was that whoever was on the top of the...
